Abstract: Putrescine transport was examined in normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts. No differences were observed in accumulation pattern, kinetics of uptake, or efflux between CF and normal cells. In both growing and growth-arrested CF and normal fibroblasts, exogenously supplied putrescine remained unchanged for at least 60 min. Some differences were observed in the response of CF and normal cells to environmental (media) changes.

Title: Immediate hypersensitivity in patients with cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Twenty-three out of thirty patients with cystic fibrosis gave strong immediate skin hypersensitivity reaction to a wide variety of allergens. Seventy-five per cent of these had a markedly elevated serum IgE concentration whereas those patients who had negative Type 1 immediate skin reactions also had normal levels of serum IgE. The sputum of those patients with immediate skin reactivity also had positive precipitins to a variety of antigens.

Title: Serum ribonuclease levels in patients with cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, usually fatal before the third decade, characterized by chronic obstructive lung disease, elevated sweat electrolyte concentrations, and pancreatic insufficiency.  The present investigation was carried out to determine if P-type serum RNase activity was reduced in CF patients 3 to 24 years of age.  No difference in serum RNase activity was found among the groups of 17 normals, 21 CF patients, and 5 CF heterozygotes.  It appears that observations of decreased RNase activity in the serum of young children with pancreatic insufficiency cannot be extended to older children, at least without withholding pancreatic supplements.

Title: Cystic fibrosis heterozygosity in the pathogenesis of allergy
Abstract: 47% of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) heterozygotes had positive prick skin tests of 1 or more of 9 antigens and 53% had histories of allergic disease, both occurring significantly more often than in a control group. Since 1 in 20 of the population are C.F. carriers, this would contribute to allergy in the community.

The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring the coordinated effort of the health care team, including specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy for this truly multisystemic disease.

Title: A screening tool to detect psychosocial adjustment of children with cystic fibrosis
Abstract: A tool to assess psychosocial adjustment of school-age children with cystic fibrosis was developed using three instruments: a standardized open-ended parent interview, a self-administered teacher questionnaire, and a self-administered parent demographic data form.  The three instruments enabled the pediatric nurse practitioner to make a clinical assessment of the child's psychosocial adjustment.  This assessment was then checked for validity by means of a social worker interview.  Implications for further research are discussed.

It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

Abstract: An adult male was recently discovered to have cystic fibrosis after a unique clinical presentation not mentioned in the review article. This patient with recurrent episodes of heat exhaustion and hyponatremia had no extraordinary source of Na+ loss other than his sweat.  This case represents an important new presentation of cystic fibrosis.  Most internists view this disease as one seen only in chronically ill children.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

The serum AFP levels in our 38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults. In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Title: An evaluation of the meconium 'lactase test' for the detection of cystic fibrosis in the newborn
Abstract: Recently, Antonowicz et al. proposed a simple test for cystic fibrosis that could be used to verify the Boehringer-Mannheim meconium test result and thus reduce the false-positive incidence. The test is based on the detection of lactase activity in meconium. The 'lactase test' may be of some value as a confirmatory test when used with the BM-mec test although its specificity in this study was not as good as previously reported.

Title: Adult cystic fibrosis: a new therapeutic challenge for the primary care physician
Abstract: In this article, we will examine the reasons for the prolonged survival of individuals with cystic fibrosis as well as discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this multisystemic disease. The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring the coordinated effort of the health care team, including specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy for this truly multisystemic disease.

Title: Biochemistry of cystic fibrosis: an overview.  pp.  157-64
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis has been a difficult problem to solve.  One amino acid is not found in elevated concentrations in the urine, one abnormal sugar or polysaccharide is not found in secretions of the bronchial tree which causes pulmonary damage, and a unique material which inhibits sodium transport has not yet been identified in sweat. Instead of viewing the current state of CF research as chaotic, perhaps we should say in a positive way that the diversity of ideas stimulates thinking, and in the process of sorting out the primary defect, a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic changes will be recognized.  Recently a positive-charged polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G has been identified which may be responsible for the ciliary dyskinesis effect of CF serum.  This material should demonstrate the same properties when bound to immunoglobulin G from control sera.  It would be interesting if it were identical with the basic protein recently found only in the serum and IgG fraction of CF patients and carriers.  Further work may identify how the polypeptide affects cell membrane surfaces, and whether a defective peptidase, perhaps an arginine esterase, fails to break down the polypeptide.  A unifying hypothesis could then emerge and tie biochemical and physiological findings together.

Title: Cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis has been regarded as a disease of infants. Yet, with improved management, a high percentage of patients how survive into young adulthood. In addition, mild cases may not be detected until long after infance. The older patient often has minimal symptoms, and the majority are socially active and  productive.

Abstract: The control of symptoms in dying children is often sadly neglected. This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two children who died of cystic fibrosis within three years of each other.  The girls were under the care of the same consultant, who in the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concern of proper terminal care for children.

It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

Title: Influence of cystic fibrotic and heterozygous serum on rat jejunum
Abstract: The rat jejunum bioassay has been shown to be capable of identifying both the cystic fibrotic homozygote and heterozygote and therefore would appear to have great potential as a screening test for the latter.  It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

Abstract: Although constipation is not well defined, when it is brought to the attention of a physician, it should raise certain questions.  In a newborn, is obstipation due to Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, or intermittent volvulus?  Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with children should consider all of these entities in each of our patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but preventable consequences.

In addition, mild cases may not be detected until long after infance. The older patient often has minimal symptoms, and the majority are socially active and  productive.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: the effect of medium from cultured cystic fibrosis fibroblasts on ATPase activity
Abstract: Culture medium from fibroblasts of cystic fibrosis patients and controls was examined for the ability to inhibit (calcium plus magnesium)-activated ATPase and (sodium plus potassium)-activated ATPase. The ATPase systems used were both a solubilised preparation from dog-fish and a membrane associated preparation from human erythrocyes. Contrary to other reports the medium from cystic fibrosis fibroblasts did not inhibit ATPase activity.

Abstract: Recently there has been a plethora of research approaches using cell culture to study cystic fibrosis.  Although these efforts can be lauded as attempts to understand one of the most common genetic disorders affecting the Caucasian population, such research should be relevant to the clinical entity known as cystic fibrosis.  The ultimate objectives of this research should be to determine the, as yet unknown, basic defect and to develop an assay for heterozygote detection.

Title: Constipation in children
Abstract: Although constipation is not well defined, when it is brought to the attention of a physician, it should raise certain questions.  In a newborn, is obstipation due to Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, or intermittent volvulus?  Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with children should consider all of these entities in each of our patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but preventable consequences.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others found raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a heterozygote carrier of the gene for cystic fibrosis and in patients with the disease and some of the siblings.  Our results do not show any significant difference in AFP levels in patients, siblings, parents, or control children.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others reported significantly increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), in the parents of the patients, and in some of their siblings in Newfoundland, Canada.  The serum AFP levels in our 38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults. In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.

Abstract: Recently there has been a plethora of research approaches using cell culture to study cystic fibrosis.  Although these efforts can be lauded as attempts to understand one of the most common genetic disorders affecting the Caucasian population, such research should be relevant to the clinical entity known as cystic fibrosis.  The ultimate objectives of this research should be to determine the, as yet unknown, basic defect and to develop an assay for heterozygote detection.

Title: Cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis has been regarded as a disease of infants. Yet, with improved management, a high percentage of patients how survive into young adulthood. In addition, mild cases may not be detected until long after infance. The older patient often has minimal symptoms, and the majority are socially active and  productive.

We have repeated these experiments under identical conditions and found no differences between the three groups.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis has been regarded as a disease of infants. Yet, with improved management, a high percentage of patients how survive into young adulthood. In addition, mild cases may not be detected until long after infance. The older patient often has minimal symptoms, and the majority are socially active and  productive.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others reported significantly increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), in the parents of the patients, and in some of their siblings in Newfoundland, Canada.  The serum AFP levels in our 38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults. In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.

Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Patients with cystic fibrosis are a special group, since a majority have chronic pulmonary infections with pseudomonas, often of a mucoid variant rarely found in other patients.

Chandra and others reported significantly increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), in the parents of the patients, and in some of their siblings in Newfoundland, Canada.  The serum AFP levels in our 38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults. In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.

Title: Cystic fibrosis in adults [letter]
Abstract: An adult male was recently discovered to have cystic fibrosis after a unique clinical presentation not mentioned in the review article. This patient with recurrent episodes of heat exhaustion and hyponatremia had no extraordinary source of Na+ loss other than his sweat.  This case represents an important new presentation of cystic fibrosis.  Most internists view this disease as one seen only in chronically ill children.

Title: False positive sweat test, malnutrition, and the Mauriac syndrome
Abstract: Mauriac syndrome is characterised by hepatomegaly, glycogen infiltration of the liver, retarded sexual maturation, and short stature in diabetic children.  We report the first example of Mauriac syndrome, in a patient clinically malnourished and edematous, who had a transient false positive sweat test.  Malnourished children who have a positive sweat test should have repeated sweat tests once the malnourished state has been reversed.  This would eliminate error in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

Abstract: Professor R. K.

Title: Cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis has been regarded as a disease of infants. Yet, with improved management, a high percentage of patients how survive into young adulthood. In addition, mild cases may not be detected until long after infance. The older patient often has minimal symptoms, and the majority are socially active and  productive.

Abstract: The rat jejunum bioassay has been shown to be capable of identifying both the cystic fibrotic homozygote and heterozygote and therefore would appear to have great potential as a screening test for the latter.  It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

Abstract: Dr Hosli and Esther Vogt reported that the alpha-mannosidase and acid phosphatase activities of cystic fibrosis plasma assayed at pH 5.4 are abnormally thermolabile at 41 degrees and 36.5 degrees C, respectively, and that the levels of residual activity after heat inactivation clearly distinguish between CF patients, CF carriers, and normal subjects.  We have repeated these experiments under identical conditions and found no differences between the three groups.
