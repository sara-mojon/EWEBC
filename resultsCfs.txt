Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others found raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a heterozygote carrier of the gene for cystic fibrosis and in patients with the disease and some of the siblings.  Our results do not show any significant difference in AFP levels in patients, siblings, parents, or control children. Probably the discrepancy in the findings will be explained by more detailed examination of the technique used.

The sputum of those patients with immediate skin reactivity also had positive precipitins to a variety of antigens.

Title: Serum ribonuclease levels in patients with cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, usually fatal before the third decade, characterized by chronic obstructive lung disease, elevated sweat electrolyte concentrations, and pancreatic insufficiency.  The present investigation was carried out to determine if P-type serum RNase activity was reduced in CF patients 3 to 24 years of age.  No difference in serum RNase activity was found among the groups of 17 normals, 21 CF patients, and 5 CF heterozygotes.  It appears that observations of decreased RNase activity in the serum of young children with pancreatic insufficiency cannot be extended to older children, at least without withholding pancreatic supplements.

Title: Cystic fibrosis heterozygosity in the pathogenesis of allergy
Abstract: 47% of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) heterozygotes had positive prick skin tests of 1 or more of 9 antigens and 53% had histories of allergic disease, both occurring significantly more often than in a control group. Since 1 in 20 of the population are C.F. carriers, this would contribute to allergy in the community.

Abstract: In this article, we will examine the reasons for the prolonged survival of individuals with cystic fibrosis as well as discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this multisystemic disease. The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring the coordinated effort of the health care team, including specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy for this truly multisystemic disease.

It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

Abstract: 47% of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) heterozygotes had positive prick skin tests of 1 or more of 9 antigens and 53% had histories of allergic disease, both occurring significantly more often than in a control group. Since 1 in 20 of the population are C.F. carriers, this would contribute to allergy in the community.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with children should consider all of these entities in each of our patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but preventable consequences.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring the coordinated effort of the health care team, including specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy for this truly multisystemic disease.

Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?

Title: Biochemistry of cystic fibrosis: an overview.  pp.  157-64
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis has been a difficult problem to solve.  One amino acid is not found in elevated concentrations in the urine, one abnormal sugar or polysaccharide is not found in secretions of the bronchial tree which causes pulmonary damage, and a unique material which inhibits sodium transport has not yet been identified in sweat. Instead of viewing the current state of CF research as chaotic, perhaps we should say in a positive way that the diversity of ideas stimulates thinking, and in the process of sorting out the primary defect, a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic changes will be recognized.  Recently a positive-charged polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G has been identified which may be responsible for the ciliary dyskinesis effect of CF serum.  This material should demonstrate the same properties when bound to immunoglobulin G from control sera.  It would be interesting if it were identical with the basic protein recently found only in the serum and IgG fraction of CF patients and carriers.  Further work may identify how the polypeptide affects cell membrane surfaces, and whether a defective peptidase, perhaps an arginine esterase, fails to break down the polypeptide.  A unifying hypothesis could then emerge and tie biochemical and physiological findings together.

Abstract: In a study of C3 levels and phenotypes in 64 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, 92 CF parents, 64 normal siblings, and 126 healthy controls, significant elevations of mean C3 levels were found in CF patients, their parents, and in one genetic sub-group of their siblins (SS females). C3 concentration in CF patients correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) score. No significant differences were found in the prevalences of C3 phenotypes or the S and F gene frequencies among the groups studied.

Chandra and others reported significantly increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), in the parents of the patients, and in some of their siblings in Newfoundland, Canada.  The serum AFP levels in our 38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults. In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.

Abstract: The intestinal brush border is a complex organelle that contains hydrolytic enzymes, receptors, other proteins involved in transport and contractile proteins.  In this article, we review the molecular organization of brush-border proteins within the whole membrane, and discuss their synthesis and turnover.  This knowledge provides a framework for understanding the mechanisms by which certain diseases are associated with changes in brush-border proteins.

Abstract: In a study of C3 levels and phenotypes in 64 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, 92 CF parents, 64 normal siblings, and 126 healthy controls, significant elevations of mean C3 levels were found in CF patients, their parents, and in one genetic sub-group of their siblins (SS females). C3 concentration in CF patients correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) score. No significant differences were found in the prevalences of C3 phenotypes or the S and F gene frequencies among the groups studied.

It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with children should consider all of these entities in each of our patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but preventable consequences.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others found raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a heterozygote carrier of the gene for cystic fibrosis and in patients with the disease and some of the siblings.  Our results do not show any significant difference in AFP levels in patients, siblings, parents, or control children.

Title: Pathophysiology of diseases involving intestinal brush-border proteins
Abstract: The intestinal brush border is a complex organelle that contains hydrolytic enzymes, receptors, other proteins involved in transport and contractile proteins.  In this article, we review the molecular organization of brush-border proteins within the whole membrane, and discuss their synthesis and turnover.  This knowledge provides a framework for understanding the mechanisms by which certain diseases are associated with changes in brush-border proteins.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: the effect of medium from cultured cystic fibrosis fibroblasts on ATPase activity
Abstract: Culture medium from fibroblasts of cystic fibrosis patients and controls was examined for the ability to inhibit (calcium plus magnesium)-activated ATPase and (sodium plus potassium)-activated ATPase. The ATPase systems used were both a solubilised preparation from dog-fish and a membrane associated preparation from human erythrocyes. Contrary to other reports the medium from cystic fibrosis fibroblasts did not inhibit ATPase activity.

It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.

C3 concentration in CF patients correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) score. No significant differences were found in the prevalences of C3 phenotypes or the S and F gene frequencies among the groups studied.

Chandra and others found raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a heterozygote carrier of the gene for cystic fibrosis and in patients with the disease and some of the siblings.  Our results do not show any significant difference in AFP levels in patients, siblings, parents, or control children. Probably the discrepancy in the findings will be explained by more detailed examination of the technique used.

Abstract: The child with cystic fibrosis presents a heart-breaking problem to parents, since the disease is inherited equally from both mother and father, and there is the possibility that other children will be similarly afflicted.  Perhaps the most valuable advice the nurse can give to parents is to adopt at all times a positive approach to their problem.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: the effect of medium from cultured cystic fibrosis fibroblasts on ATPase activity
Abstract: Culture medium from fibroblasts of cystic fibrosis patients and controls was examined for the ability to inhibit (calcium plus magnesium)-activated ATPase and (sodium plus potassium)-activated ATPase. The ATPase systems used were both a solubilised preparation from dog-fish and a membrane associated preparation from human erythrocyes. Contrary to other reports the medium from cystic fibrosis fibroblasts did not inhibit ATPase activity.

Title: Constipation in children
Abstract: Although constipation is not well defined, when it is brought to the attention of a physician, it should raise certain questions.  In a newborn, is obstipation due to Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, or intermittent volvulus?  Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with children should consider all of these entities in each of our patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but preventable consequences.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Title: Constipation in children
Abstract: Although constipation is not well defined, when it is brought to the attention of a physician, it should raise certain questions.  In a newborn, is obstipation due to Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, or intermittent volvulus?  Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with children should consider all of these entities in each of our patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but preventable consequences.

Title: Letter: Life tables for cystic fibrosis
Abstract: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Abstract: The child with cystic fibrosis presents a heart-breaking problem to parents, since the disease is inherited equally from both mother and father, and there is the possibility that other children will be similarly afflicted.  Perhaps the most valuable advice the nurse can give to parents is to adopt at all times a positive approach to their problem.

Is obstipation in a child with a mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the child constipated for psychogenic reasons?
