Title: The fight against cystic fibrosis
Authors: Wheatley-B
Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis is a generalized hereditary disorder of children, adolescents, and young adults in which there is widespread dysfunction of mucus-secreting glands.  The patient's condition may be characterized by one or all of the following: chronic pulmonary disease, pancreatic enzyme deficiency and abnormally high sweat electrolytes.  Hence, each patient is treated on an individual basis. Parents tied to a rigid regime imposed by the disease must have help; volunteers are needed to support and assist them at home and at school.  Cystic Fibrosis still needs a lot of help, and knowledge and understanding on the part of the nursing profession helps a great deal.

Title: Conjunctival goblet cells in patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Holm-K, Kessing-S-V
Abstract: In five patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the mucous glandular system of the conjunctiva was studied, as changes, if any, in the conjunctival goblet cells might be applicable as a diagnostic test in questionable cases. A whole-mount technique was used, specially developed for studying conjunctival goblet cells. In all five cases the qualitative as well as quantitative goblet-cell findings were in accordance with a previously reported normal material. In particular, there were no signs of stagnated secretion.

Title: Plasma tocopherol in infants and children
Authors: McWhirter-W-R
Abstract: A study has been made of plasma tocopherol concentrations in normal children and in children with intestinal abnormalities. A positive correlation between plasma tocopherol and age is shown between the ages of 4 months and 10 years. Most patients with cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease were found to have markedly reduced plasma tocopherol concentrations in comparison with the normal children of similar age.

Title: Glycosidases in human skin fibroblast cultures.  Alpha-fucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-mannosidase, and N-acetyl-alpha-glucosaminidase
Authors: Hultberg-B, Sjoblad-S, Ockerman-P-A
Abstract: Five glycosidases, alpha-fucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha- glucosidase, beta-mannosidase and N-acetyl-alpha-glucosaminidase were studied in human skin fibroblast cultures. The pH-dependency, kinetic properties of the enzymes and results of isoelectric focusing and ion exchange chromatography are presented. Techniques suitable for diagnosing inborn lysosomal diseases in skin fibroblast cultures are defined.

Title: Electrical polarization of rectal mucosa and excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone in patients with cystic fibrosis of pancreas and in normal subjects
Authors: Rask-Madsen-J, Schiotz-P-O, Bartels-U, Nielsen-M-D
Abstract: The electrical potential difference (PD) across the rectal wall was measured in 26 patients with cystic fibrosis of pancreas (CFP) and in 18 healthy subjects. The PDs obtained in normal children were identical to those previously obtained in normal adults. A significantly greater dispersion of the values was observed in CFP. When the patients were divided into groups according to metachromasia in fibroblast cultures, the mean PD was increased only in the ametachromatic group. True enough, this observation suggests a difference between various forms of CFP, distinguished by metachromasia, and thus is a further indication of the heterogeneity of the disease. The greater abnormalities in metachromasia negative patients may, however, be due solely to the fact that these patients are more severely affected by the disease. The urinary excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone in patients was within the ranges obtained in controls, which excludes the possibility of secondary hyperaldosteronism as the source of increased PD. No evidence was provided in favour of a basic defect in the intestinal transport of Na+ or Cl minus, but K+ concentrations in faecal fluids of patients were significantly lower than in controls. The equilibrium concentration of K+ could be accounted for by simple passive diffusion, suggesting that the epithelium behaved inertly with respect to this ion in CFP.

Title: Letter: Measurement of electrical potential difference across colonic mucosa in cystic fibrosis patients
Authors: Darby-C-W, Edmonds-C-J
Abstract: By measuring potential difference between rectal mucosa and perianal skin using a reference electrode placed on the forearm, we demonstrated an altered potential difference in cystic children compared with control adults and normal children.  We suggested this might be due to an alteration in the rectal mucosa potential or altered skin potential, or both, in cystic fibrosis.  We measured skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line.  Using this technique we showed that the cystic fibrosis patients (C.F.) have an abnormal perianal skin potential difference compared with readings we obtained in normal children.  There was little difference in the transmural rectal potential difference between our cystic patients and previously reported values in normal adults. Thus the recent paper confirms our findings of normal polarity of the rectal mucosa surface and the increased skin polarisation in cystic fibrosis.

Title: Additional data on hepatic function tests in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Feigelson-J, Pecau-Y, Cathelineau-L, Navarro-J
Abstract: Fifty cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, of whom 9 had multilobular cirrhosis, were observed regularly for a period of 3 years and various liver function tests, indicating cytolysis, cholestasis and cellular insufficiency were performed. Immunoglobulin and prothrombin were assayed. In 9 patients with cirrhosis, the tests were generally abnormal. Two distinct biochemical patterns of cirrhosis were distinguished, one clearly cholestatic and the other of a more cellular type. The distinction was made on the basis of the IgA : Transferrin ratio and of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase levels. In the non-cirrhotic patients, a temporary increase of cytolysis and cholestasis was observed in 50% of the cases.

Title: Screening for cystic fibrosis by analysis of albumin in meconium
Authors: Kollberg-H, Hellsing-K
Abstract: A clinical study of the albumin content in meconium was performed on two categories of newborn infants: a screening series of 8,830 infants and a high-risk group for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) of 70 infants. A single radial immunodiffusion technique and test strips were used. Three CF infants were detected in the screening series (1:3,000) and 16 in the high-risk group. The diagnostic accuracy for CF was fairly good. The specificity was 99.8% for the immunodiffusion technique and 99.2% for test strips. A high concentration of albumin in meconium was found not only in CF but also in preterm babies and infants with gastrointestinal disturbances, such as atresias, malaena neonatorum and malabsorption syndromes. The sensitivity was 90% for the immunodiffusion technique and 78% for the test strip. False-negative results were probably due to proteolytic activity and might be avoided if the samples are stored at a low temperature before analysis. CF screening of all meconiums by the use of test strips followed by analysis of positive tests by the immunodiffusion technique is suggested.

Title: Epidemiological markers for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  6. Relationship between concomitant non-mucoid and mucoid strains from the respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Bergan-T, Hoiby-N
Abstract: The simultaneously occurring mucoid (M) and non-mucoid (NM) variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently observed in cultures from the respiratory tract of chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients have been studied. M cultures in vitro were unstable and easily dissociated NM colonies. In a large proportion of the cases, M and NM variants occurring simultaneously in cultures from one and the same clinical specimen were of the same pyocine type, phage type, and serogroup. In some remaining cases there were small differences between the M and NM variants such that identity between the variants from one and the same specimen was possible, although not definite. The NM dissociants from M strains were of the same type as the M variant. The possible role of cross-infection and the interaction of bacteria and host response factors continuously tending to select the unstable M variant in vivo are discussed.

Title: Prevalence of mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacteriological specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with other diseases
Authors: Hoiby-N
Abstract: The relative prevalence of mucoid strains compared with non-mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been investigated in all routine bacteriological specimens received in a department of clinical microbiology during 1973. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 1054 of the specimens (5.7 per cent) representing 53 patients with cystic fibrosis (551 isolates) and 169 patients with other diseases (503 isolates). The relative prevalence of mucoid strains was significantly higher in specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis (80 per cent) than in specimens from patients with other diseases (3 per cent). Considering patients without cystic fibrosis, the relative prevalence of mucoid strains was low in specimens from all anatomical regions, and no special preference of these strains for the respiratory tract could be demonstrated in these patients, in contrast to the situation in patients with cystic fibrosis. Alternation between mucoid strains and non-mucoid strains in subsequent specimens was observed in 33 of the patients.

Title: The serology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa analysed by means of quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods.  II.  Comparison of the antibody response in man against thirteen O groups of Ps. aeruginosa
Authors: Hoiby-N
Abstract: The occurrence of antibodies against antigens prepared from strains representing 13 O groups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against a polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen (St-Ag) has been investigated in sera from 100 patients. By means of fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel it was found that the humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa resulting in precipitating antibodies will be detected by St-Ag as well as by any other of the antigen samples investigated. Six of the sera contained group-specific antibodies which were revealed by only one of the antigen samples used and not by St-Ag. These six sera were further studied by means of various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods using St-Ag as well as antigens prepared from the infecting Ps. aeruginosa strain in the patient concerned. In all six sera, only one extra precipitin could be detected using antigens prepared from the homologous strain instead of St-Ag. This extra precipitin corresponded presumably to group-specific O-antigens not included in St-Ag. In sera from patients, these group-specific antibodies were always accompanied by antibodies against antigens common to all strains of Ps. aeruginosa.

Title: Staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis: antibiotic sensitivity and phage types during the latest decade.  Investigation of the occurrence of protein A and some other properties of recently isolated strains in relation to the occurrence of precipitating antibodies
Authors: Hoff-G-E, Hoiby-N
Abstract: During the recent decade, 1651 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from 111 patients with cystic fibrosis have been tested for antibiotic sensitivity and half of the isolates have been phage typed. All the patients were followed in one clinic and the policy of antibiotic treatment was consistent during this period. The results show a dynamic situation where "epidemic" phage types during recent years have been gradually replaced by other types and, during the same period, the prevalence of strains resistant to more than one antibiotic decreased. Multiresistant strains including strains resistant to methicillin were infrequent in these patients. From 23 per cent of the patients, the same strains were repeatedly isolated for more than 1 year despite an apparently successful chemotherapy. Recently isolated strains were found to produce cellbound as well as extracellular protein A. Ninety-one per cent of the strains produced extracellular lipase and only 8 per cent were resistant to mercury chloride. Eighty-one per cent of the patients produced precipitating antibodies against S. aureus as judged by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The investigated properties of S. aureus were not significantly correlated with the occurrence of precipitating antibodies against these bacteria. The possible significance of protein A in the pathology of the respiratory tract infection is discussed.

Title: Effects of malnutrition on the maturing central nervous system
Authors: Winick-M
Abstract: During recent years, more and more data have been accumulated implicating early malnutrition in subsequent small stature and behavioral abnormalities.  These studies can be divided into two large categories: one dealing with cellular and biochemical changes at a tissue level and one dealing with functional changes within the nervous system as measured by changes in various modes of behavior. This chapter will attempt to review the studies in both of these broad categories, which have led to the present concept that malnutrition during the growing period will permanently retard growth, resulting in a stunted individual, and markedly retard psychologic development, resulting in an individual with permanently altered behaviors.  We shall first consider the normal cellular and biochemical development of the central nervous system; second, we shall examine how malnutrition alters these cellular and biochemical processes; and finally, we shall review the evidence that implicates early malnutrition with alterations in later behavior and ability to learn.

Title: Dietary supplement and nutrition in children with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Berry-H-K, Kellogg-F-W, Hunt-M-M, Ingberg-R-L, Richter-L
Abstract: Assessment of nutritional status of patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CFP) showed that poor growth was associated with low concentrations of albumin, urea nitrogen, and cholesterol in serum and with elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts. Patients with CFP maintained weight approximately 1 standard deviation below the mean until 8 years, after which there was a progressive decline in growth rate compared to normal. A complete dietary supplement consisting of a beef serum hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain triglycerides was given to 15 patients for a year. Patients who received the diet showed significant gains in weight, significant increase in clinical score, significant increase in serum albumin level, and a significant drop in the WBC count compared to control patients who did not receive the supplement.

Title: Pneumatosis coli in cystic fibrosis: clinical, radiological, and pathological features
Authors: Wood-R-E, Herman-C-J, Johnson-K-W, di-SantAgnese-P-A
Abstract: A patient with cystic fibrosis was found to have pneumatosis coli associted with rectal prolapse.  In cystic fibrosis there are several factors predisposing to pneumatosis, yet it is rarely reported.  Symptoms are nonspecific, and the diagnosis should be considered in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease and vague abdominal complaints.

Title: Cystic fibrosis and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in children. Report of three cases
Authors: Athreya-B-H, Borns-P, Rosenlund-M-L
Abstract: Three patients with cystic fibrosis were noted to have swelling of knee and ankle joints during exacerbation of their lung disease. Synovial fluid was analyzed in one patient and the synovium underwent biopsy in another. These studies excluded other causes of arthritis but did not contribute any new information on the nature of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Radiological examination of long bones confirmed the diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in all three patients. Since many patients with cystic fibrosis survive longer, more instances of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy are expected in the future.

Title: Compliance and self-medication in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Meyers-A, Dolan-T-F-Jr, Mueller-D
Abstract: Sixty-one patients with cystic fibrosis were studied to determine the relationship between degree of compliance with taking antibiotics and severity of the disease. The compliance rate was high in these patients, suggesting that perception of the severity of the disease and the potential consequences of discontinuing medication is a principal factor.

Title: Letter: Nutritional supplementation in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Lober-C-W
Abstract: Duke Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health have analyzed the maximum achieved heights and weights of 60 persons with CF over 20 years old.  Both parameters were markedly skewed toward the lower percentile bands.  No significant differences were found among patients whose condition was diagnosed early in life, in those with more severe pulmonary or gastrointestinal impairment, or among those in whom pancreatic enzyme and/or nutritional supplementation had been employed.  Nutritional supplementation has yet to be proven a significant long-term influence on the morbidity or mortality of CF. - Lober reported data on 60 persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) over 20 years of age, while our population of 63 individuals contained only three who were over 15 years old.  The median age of death in patients with CF is 12 years.  It is not realistic to compare patients who have survived to adulthood with a younger group.  He did not state the type of nutritional supplementation that was of no significance among his patients.  Our experience with nutritional supplements other than the amino acid-glucose polymer mixture has been equally poor.  Our data on growth rates were similar to those of Lober in that both heights and weights were skewed toward the lower end, and height was less affected than weight.  Increased rates of linear growth were observed in eight of 13 children under 12 years of age at the time the dietary supplement was begun.  Patients who continue to take the nutritional supplement have not shown further deterioration in pulmonary status.

Title: Nonoperative treatment of meconium ileus equivalent
Authors: Perman-J, Breslow-L, Ingal-D
Abstract: Intraluminal bowel obstruction secondary to inspissated feces is a known complication of cystic fibrosis. When seen in the older child, it is termed "meconium ileus equivalent." We studied a case in which nonsurgical resolution of the obstruction was obtained with N- acetylcysteine enemas and pancreatic replacement enzymes given orally and by enema. The pathogenesis of this disorder and the basis for the treatment are described. Recognition of this complication and familiarity with its medical management are important in caring for the older child with cystic fibrosis.

Title: Aspergillus antibody in patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Bardana-E-J-Jr, Sobti-K-L, Cianciulli-F-D, Noonan-M-J
Abstract: The respiratory flora of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently includes Aspergillus, and 30% of their serum samples have been observed to contain precipitating antibody to this fungus. Serum from 61 CF patients, 60 healthy persons, and three patients with CF and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was studied, using a quantitative assay for antibody to A fumigatus. Although CF patients had significantly higher levels of Aspergillus antibody, some antibody was found in all serum samples from normal individuals. Binding was immunologically specific for A fumigatus. Serum IgE levels and dermal reactivity to Aspergillus were similar in both CF and normal subjects. Increased levels of Aspergillus antibody in CF patients probably reflect pulmonary colonization, which only rarely causes infection or sensitization.

Title: Use of a Pseudomonas Aeruginosa vaccine in pateints with acute leukemia and cystic fibrosis
Authors: Pennington-J-E, Reynolds-H-Y, Wood-R-E, Robinson-R-A, Levine-A-S
Abstract: A heptavalent lipopolysaccharide Pseudomonas vaccine was evaluated in 22 patients with acute leukemia and 12 patients with cystic fibrosis during an 18 month interval at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health. Of the 34 patients, 32 had an excellent serum hemagglutinating (HA) antibody response to immunization. In comparison to the patients with cystic fibrosis, the patients with leukemia had a smaller HA antibody response, which lasted a shorter period of time, and also}i experienced greater toxicity from the vaccine. The mixing of adrenal corticosteroids with vaccine greatly decreased side reactions among the patients with leukemia without significantly inhibiting antibody production. Previous antineoplastic chemotherapy had little influence on antibody response in patients with leukemia, with the exception of methortrexate. Vaccinated patients with leukemia had 1 Pseudomonas infection of 14 bacterial or fungal infections, whereas 2 pseudomonas infections of 5 bacterial or fungal infections occurred in a control group of 20 patients with acute leukemia. Of the 12 patients with cystic fibrosis, 4 had a Pseudomonas infection after vaccination.

Title: Family adjustment to cystic fibrosis
Authors: Burnette-B-A
Abstract: A nurse and mother describes the clinical effects of cystic fibrosis on patients and the long-term demands the disease places on her own and other children and families.  Diagnosis is mainly accomplished with an analysis of sweat for sodium and chloride ions.  CF is transmitted as a Mendelian recessive trait.  It is a generalized dysfunction of the endocrine glands.  The abnormalities, seemingly unrelated, appear as loss of electrolytes through the sweat and salivary glands and as unusually thick, sticky mucus secretions that obstruct and damage the patient's pancreas, lungs, gallbladder, intestines, and liver.  The objective of pulmonary therapy are to decrease viscosity of the pulmonary secretions and to improve and maintain pulmonary hygiene.  Financial cost is only one of many burdens on the family.

Title: Studies on the synthesis of plasma membrane proteins of fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Changus-J-E, Quissell-D-O, Sukup-M-R, Pitot-H-C
Abstract: The characteristic increased salinity of sweat and other abnormalities of exocrine secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suggest the possibility of a disturbed functioning of the plasma membrane in this disease. Several lines of evidence indicate that fibroblasts express the presence of the CF genotype. Therefore these cells were used in an in vitro study directed at determining whether the manifestations of CF might be related to an alteration of one or more of the protein components of the plasma membrane. In order to evaluate the synthesis of these components, growing fibrosblasts from patients with CF and normal subjects were briefly exposed to either 14C- or 3-H-leucine. Their plasma membranes were then isolated and subjected to analysis in a nondetergent acrylamide gel system. Coelectrophoresis of differentially labeled preparations revealed the absence of a detectable abnormality in the synthetic rates of any of the more than 30 resolved protein species.

Title: Carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3 in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Lieberman-J
Abstract: Assays of carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3 in serum from patients with cystic fibrosis and appropriate control subjects failed to demonstrate a deficiency of carboxypeptidase B-like activity or a consistent increase in C3, as was suggested by Conover and associates. Differences between men and women with cystic fibrosis were apparent, in that women with cystic fibrosis had higher concentrations of both serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3 than either men with cystic fibrosis or control subjects.

Title: Relationship of arterial-alveolar nitrogen tension to alveolar-arterial oxygen tension, lung volume, flow measurements, and diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Corbet-A, Ross-J, Popkin-J, Beaudry-P
Abstract: Pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis was assessed by the arterial-alveolar PN2 difference adjusted to sublingual temperature. The resulting values were compared with the alveolar- arterial PO2 difference, arterial PCO2, and standard measurements of lung volume, flow, and diffusing capacity. The arterial-alveolar PN2 difference was nearly one half of the PO2 difference, both early in the disease and at a more advanced stage. Analysis taking into account the O2 dissociation curve and the possibility that alveolar temperature is higher than sublingual temperature suggested that all of the PO2 difference could be explained in terms of ventilation- perfusion imbalance in gas-filled units of the lung. Reduction of fractional CO uptake with increasing PN2 difference suggested that the decrease in diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis may be explained by ventilation-perfusion inequality. A significant relationship between arterial PCO2 and the PN2 difference supported the view that ventilation-perfusion inequality is the cause of CO2 retention when present. The PN2 and PO2 differences were abnormal before the standard tests of lung volume and flow, but in general, the correlation was excellent. Because the PN2 difference was not superior to the PO2 difference in detecting early disease, and because the technical problems in its measurement are considerable, it is not recommended as a routine measurement.

Title: Open thoracotomy for pneumothorax in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Stowe-S-M, Boat-T-F, Mendelsohn-H, Stern-R-C, Tucker-A-S
Abstract: The results of open thoractomy and pleurectomy or pleural abrasion for 17 episodes of pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis were compared with the results of observation, closed thoracostomy, and closed thoracostomy with sclerosing agents. Open thoracotomy had the advantage of insuring prompt resolution of the pneumothorax. A small incision minimized postoperative morbidity. The average hospital stay was 15 days after open thoracotomy and 19 days after closed thoracostomy, with or without sclerosing agents. Complications of all treatments were infrequent. A limited symptomatic recurrence was observed in 2 of 17 pneumothoraces successfully treated with open thoracotomy. Recurrence also occurred in 1 of 8 treated with observation, 3 of 9 treated with closed thoracostomy, and 1 of 14 treated with closed thoracostomy and sclerosing agents. A loss of vital capacity was usually noted 4 to 18 months after resolution, regardless of treatment. Forty per cent of patients in both operative and nonoperative groups survived 3 years. In our experience, open thoracotomy can be used safely for treatment of unresolved or recurrent pneumothorax and warrants further evaluation as a primary therapy for pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Title: Contribution of inhomogeneity of lung units to the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve in children with asthma and cystic fibrosis
Authors: Landau-L-I, Taussig-L-M, Macklem-P-T, Beaudry-P-H
Abstract: Normal children as well as those with asthma and cystic fibrosis were studied to assess the contribution of lung zones emptying at different rates to the curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow- volume curve. Lung volumes, maximal expiratory flow-volume curves breathing air and then breathing a helium-oxygen mixture, and single- breath nitrogen washouts were measured. Forced expiratory maneuvers from lung volumes near functional residual capacity were performed to produce transients of flow exceeding maximal flow defined by the full flow-volume curve. Normal children and those with asthma and mild cystic fibrosis had small or no transients. Those with severe cystic fibrosis had large transients as well as increased phase I on the nitrogen washout curves. These large transients were associated with increased curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve and smaller than normal flow response breathing helium. In severe cystic fibrosis, the large transients suggest sequential emptying of fast and slow spaces, which influences the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve. The fast space could be due to compression of an enlarged anatomic dead space. Any time constant inequality between parenchymal units present in asthma and mild cystic fibrosis does not appear to contribute significantly to the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve.

Title: Tracheal mucociliary transport in patients with cystic fibrosis and its stimulation by terbutaline
Authors: Wood-R-E, Wanner-A, Hirsch-J, Farrell-P-M
Abstract: Tracheal mucous velocity was measured by observing the motion of teflon discs across the tracheal mucosa through a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The average rate of movement in 14 adult patients with cystic fibrosis was 2.6 mm per min plus or minus 3.3 SD, compared with 20.1 mm per min plus or minus 6.3 in 20 normal subjects of the same age (P less than 0.001). This failure of mucociliary transport may play a role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis. Administration of a beta-adrenergic agent, terbutaline, increased the average mucous velocity in the patients with cystic fibrosis (to 5.5 mm per min plus or minus 3.6 SD, P less than 0.001) but not in control subjects. This observation has potential therapeutic significance.

Title: Mucociliary clearance
Authors: Rossman-C-M, Dolovich-M, Dolovich-J, Wilson-W, Newhouse-M
Abstract: Mucociliary clearance data obtained by our group in relatively healthy cystic fibrosis subjects was not affected by cough.  The majority of subjects mentioned in the original article did not cough during the study and indeed were chosen because they were relatively healthy at the time.  It was possible to study them over fairly long periods without interference from cough and thus the relatively normal clearance times demonstrated were presumably due to mucociliary transport.  Reference was made to nasal mucociliary clearance studies in patients with cystic fibrosis and normal subjects which indicated that clearance was similar in both groups until mild inflammation of the nasal mucosa was produced.  We would like to point out that the work was performed in our Laboratory, since no reference was given in the discussion.

Title: Congenital metabolic diseases of pediatric patients: anesthetic implications
Authors: Brown-B-R-Jr, Walson-P-D, Taussig-L-M
Abstract: The large number of congenital metabolic disorders makes a complete discussion of the biochemical problems, hazards, pharmacologic implications, and anesthetic recommendations for each impossible. This review is confined to discussion of certain aspects of several genetically acquired diseases of metabolism which the anaesthesiologist may be called upon to manage in the pediatric patient.  Every genetic metabolic disease is the result of a specific enzyme defect (or defects) in function or in amount.  In this review, diseases in which defects are known (e.g., homocystinuria), suspected (e.g., myotonia congenita), and unknown (e.g., cystic fibrosis) are discussed.  Therapeutic approaches to genetic metabolic disease include: supplying the missing product; preventing substrate accumulation; preventing alternate product synthesis; enzyme induction; enzyme replacement; increasing deficient function with cofactor administration; and compensatory therapy.  Obviously, the ideal way to treat the consequences of a genetic disease is to normalize the patient biochemically.  For diseases where the pathophysiology is clear, this goal is approachable; for conditions where the pathophysiology is unknown, only compensatory therapy is possible.

Title: Data on the HL-A linkage group
Authors: Lamm-L-U, Thorsen-I-L, Petersen-G-B, Jorgensen-J, Henningsen-K
Abstract: Lod scores from a study in 229 families of the linkage relations of HL-A-PGM3 to 19 marker loci and cystic fibrosis are reported. The data exclude that ADA belongs to this linkage group while they give weak support for the inclusion of P. There is weak evidence for linkage of cystic fibrosis to PGM3, but none for linkage to HL-A. No new suggestive linkages appeared.

Title: Low blood pressure in young adults with cystic fibrosis: an effect of chronic salt loss in sweat?
Authors: Lieberman-J, Rodbard-S
Abstract: Young adults with cystic fibrosis have lower blood pressures than control subjects of similar age and sex. The low blood pressure may be related to the excessive loss of salt in the sweat of these patients. A beneficial effect of the cystic fibrosis gene may be protection against developing hypertension in both the homozygous and heterozygous states, especially if the heterozygote has borderline elevation of sweat electrolytes.

Title: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections: persisting problems and current research to find new therapies
Authors: No authors available
Abstract: Despite the availability of specific antibiotics, Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria still cause troublesome infections in patients with a variety of illnesses: extensive thermal injury, leukopenia from antineoplastic chemotherapy and other forms of immunosuppressive treatment, chronic pulmonary disease such as cystic fibrosis, or intravenous narcotic use. The use of antibiotics has improved the prognosis of pseudomonas infections considerably. However, patients with marginal or defective host immunity may need more extensive therapy to master the infection. By evaluating additional modalities of treatment such as granulocyte replacement, improved usage of antibiotics, and active (prophylaxis) or passive antibody administration, the optimal combination may be found.

Title: Ciliary inhibition and axonemal microtubule alterations in freshwater mussels
Authors: Adshead-P-C, Martinez-J-R, Kilburn-K-H, Hess-R-A
Abstract: A phenomenon associated with the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the presence of a serum factor that stops or discoordinates ciliary beating.  This effect has been demonstrated by exposing freshwater mussel or oyster gill cilia, or rabbit tracheal cilia, to sera from homozygous or heterozygous cystic fibrosis subjects.  Assay reproducibility is unsatisfactory, however, and the mechanism of the effect is not understood.  Nor do we know why there may be considerable differences between the activity of tested heterozygotes and of homozygotes.  Because the ciliary assay is capricious, there is a need to understand how ciliary beating is disturbed or stopped. Since microtubules are important in the mechanism of ciliary motion, they could conceivably show alterations during the response to inhibitory substances.  There has been no ultrastructural study, however, of the effects of ciliary inhibition on the axonemal components.  Therefore, this study was designed to examine ciliary structure during the different stages of ciliary inhibition.  Rapid microtubular disappearance and reappearance occurs in the terminal cilia of the freshwater mussel Unio when exposure to CF serum causes a shock-stop reaction, and return to water allows resumption of normal ciliary beating.  In contrast, a slow-stop reaction causes distortion of cilia, asynchronous beating, and ejection of cells from the distal gill filament, but ciliary axonemal structure is preserved.  Slow-stopped cilia do not resume their beating in water. Saliva from reserpine-treated rats causes ciliary inhibition similar to that induced by CF serum.

Title: Primary peritonitis in infancy and childhood
Authors: McDougal-W-S, Izant-R-J-Jr, Zollinger-R-M-Jr
Abstract: Primary peritonitis, rarely diagnosed preoperatively, is an uncommon disease accounting for 2.1% of all pediatric abdominal emergencies. It is often associated with urinary or hepatic pathology, the former the source of the infecting organism in the majority of cases, and presents with characteristic symptoms depending upon whether it occurs in infancy or childhood. The symptoms and signs which allow for a positive prospective diagnosis are illustrated by comparing this disease to those entities with which it is most often confused, e.g. diffuse peritonitis of other etiologies, and include a short duration of symptoms, associated urinary tract infection and an absence of free air on abdominal roentgenograms. In the past, gram positive organisms were the most common infecting agent; however, in this series gram negative bacteria accounted for 69% or the organisms. Antibiotics with a gram negative spectrum and exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy are the hallmarks of therapy, the latter replaced by abdominal tap only in the patient who satisfies the criteria for primary peritonitis and in whom an associated disease makes the risk of surgery prohibitive.

Title: Genetic screening
Authors: Childs-B
Abstract: The recent proliferation of genetic knowledge has been accompanied by speculation about its uses in the pursuit of both medical and social goals, as well as by fear and concern about possible misuses.  These speculations have appeared in the proceedings of numerous symposia and in many books and papers.  A review of this literature reveals that the nonmedical participants in this debate were preoccupied with those aims of genetics that might benefit (or threaten) society, while the physicians were concerned with the accomplishment of standard medical missions in which social aims figure only incidentally.  These missions are diagnosis, management, and prevention of disease.  The specific uses of genetic knowledge most frequently mentioned were advances in the taxonomy of disease that lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of individual patients and their relatives, genetic counseling, and genetic screening.  The latter two, particularly screening, are preventive and represent the interface between medical genetics, especially population genetics, and society.  This review focuses on developments in genetic screening, defined as the search in a population, generally for medical reasons, for individuals possessing particular genotypes.

Title: Liver scans in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Goodchild-M-C, Banks-A-J, Drolc-Z, Anderson-C-M
Abstract: Liver scans were performed on 16 cystic fibrosis patients. Most scans were considered abnormal. In most patients, the results of serological liver function tests were normal. Liver scanning in cystic fibrosis is unlikely to make a significant contribution to an assessment of prognosis.

Title: Aspects of bile acid metabolism in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Goodchild-M-C, Murphy-G-M, Howell-A-M, Nutter-S-A, Anderson-C-M
Abstract: Previous reports have indicated that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency have a raised faecal bile acid output.  In this study, 18 out of 29 CF patients and 2 out of the 4 non-CF patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency had raised faecal bile acid levels.  In the CF patients no correlation was found between faecal bile acid and faecal fat excretion, but an inverse relation was shown between faecal bile acid values and age. Those CF patients with overt liver disease tended to have the lowest faecal bile acid values.  Duodenal spiration in 5 CF patients and in one non-CF patient with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (Shwachman-Diamond syndrome), produced very small fluid volumes. Duodenal fluid mean total bile acid concentrations were within normal limits.  Estimation of serum bile acids in these 6 patients showed that 3 patients had raised serum bile acid values.  It is suggested that excessive faecal bile acid loss may produce a contraction of the bile acid pool, and lead eventually to a reduction of intraduodenal bile acid concentrations.  Measures which curtail faecal bile acid loss may have a particular significance in the management of CF.

Title: Letter: Bronchial lability in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Jones-R-S
Abstract: It has always seemed to me that the use of the Exercise Lability Index (ELI) distorts results and may be misleading because a falsely high value for lability is obtained when the PEF at rest is low.  It is incorrect to compare percentage values from such patients with percentage values from those with figures at rest which are near to normal.  The Jones Liability Index avoids this distortion.  I do not suggest that a proportion of CF patients do not have abnormal lability but would maintain that the ELI introduces inaccuracy which may blur the distinction between CF and other respiratory conditions and may lead to the postulation of problems concerning lability in CF which do not necessarily exist.  Failure to use a bronchodilator agent to reinforce brief exercise may also cause distortion but in the opposite direction.

Title: Unusual clinical course in a child with cystic fibrosis treated with fat emulsion
Authors: Elliott-R-B, Robinson-P-G
Abstract: A child diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis by customary criteria has been given regular parenteral soya oil emulsion from near birth. Sweat tests have improved, pancreatic achylia was relieved, and the child at present remains entirely well. Correction of the essential fatty acid deficiency found in cystic fibrosis may prevent some of the manifestations of the disease.

Title: Letter: Essential fatty acids in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Dodge-J-A, Prosser-R, Yassa-J
Abstract: We have read with interest the report by Elliott and Robinson concerning the apparent beneficial effects of intravenous fat infusions in a child with cystic fibrosis.  We question whether the increase in essential fatty acids brought about by soya oil can account for the favourable course of the disease in this patient. Our own observations confirm that essential fatty acids levels are often below normal in cystic fibrosis, but they do not correlate with the clinical condition of the patient.  It seems unlikely that minor degrees of essential fatty acid deficiency would impair prostaglandin synthesis, or give rise to the usual clinical features of cystic fibrosis. - Our own more recent research in platelet aggregation, prostaglandin, and cyclic nucleotide production, makes us aware that simple EFA deficiency per se cannot be the origin of the symptoms of CF.  The possibility that some other agent in the infusion mixture (which, for example, contains about 12% tocopherol) may be a contributing factor, is also under investigation.  This does not, however, invalidate a possible therapeutic effect of EFA in the disease, and in particular, a partial correlation of a possible disorder of prostaglandin synthesis.

Title: Insulin release in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Kjellman-N-I, Larsson-Y
Abstract: Early insulin response to rapid intravenous injection of glucose was studied in 7 cases of cystic fibrosis aged 8 months to 9 1/2 years. Plasma insulin was measured with a radioimmunological method. Blood glucose values were determined and the glucose disappearance rate (kG) calculated. In all children except the youngest one the early insulin response values were low compared with normal children. The kG-values were normal and correlated neither to the duration of clinical symptoms, nor to the patients' actual clinical condition measured by means of the Shwachman score. The explanation of the decreased insulin response is probably the progressive fibrosis of the pancreas. This may also explain the reported increased incidence of diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis. Comparison is made with the condition in pancreatic fibrosis in rabbits, produced through duct ligation.

Title: Negative sweat tests and cystic fibrosis
Authors: Sarsfield-J-K, Davies-J-M
Abstract: Two brothers are described with chronic suppurative pulmonary disease. One has classical cystic fibrosis with complete pancreatic involvement and abnormal sweat test. The other had incomplete pancreatic disease with repeatedly normal sweat tests. The implications of a negative sweat test in patients with cystic fibrosis are discussed.

Title: Prevalence of atopy and exercise-induced bronchial lability in relatives of patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Counahan-R, Mearns-M-B
Abstract: Skin tests and exercise tests were performed on children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and first-degree relatives of CF children. Positive skin tests were found in 56% of patients and 19% of relatives, but the prevalence of atopy in CF patients bore no relationship to its prevalence in their relatives. Increased 0ronchial lability, mainly due to bronchoconstriction, was present in 54% of patients and 27% of relatives. The results showed that increased prevalence of bronchial lability, but not atopy, is found in first-degree relatives of CF children, and that the abnormal lability and atopy found in CF children does not indicate a familial allergic background.

Title: Trial of artificial diet in treatment of cystic fibrosis of pancreas
Authors: Barclay-R-P, Shannon-R-S
Abstract: Twelve patients with cystic fibrosis were started on an artificial diet of Albumaid and Caloreen, together with a supplement of medium chain triglyceride oil, vitamins, and minerals.  Growth velocity and general health were assessed over a period of a full year for each child.  Patients who were only mildly affected by the disease showed improvement in stool frequency and growth rate when the diet represented the major part of their nutritional intake.  Patients who were severely affected showed no improvement in growth, general clinical status, or frequency of respiratory infections.

Title: Letter: Management of children with cystic fibrosis
Authors: No authors available
Abstract: Reports of children with cystic fibrosis living well whilst on intensive treatment can be covered by allegations that their disease must be basically mild.  More revealing evidence comes from the longterm survival studies done by Professor Warren Warwick, of the University of Minnesota.  The introduction of antibiotics have allowed the children to live loner, but 3/4 were dead by aged 10 years.  Physiotherapy given after infections prolonged lives so that half were still alive at 10 years - but still faced a relentless death rate.  Prophylactic - daily - physiotherapy produced a doubling of survival at 20 years from under 30% to over 60%.  I do not deny for a moment that daily physiotherapy with inhalations is a great strain on the family, but it is not as great as the strain of watching the slow and relentless decline of the child which, with racking cough and persistent dyspnoea, is anything but peaceful.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: the ciliary inhibitor is a small polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G
Authors: Bowman-B-H, Lankford-B-J, Fuller-G-M, Carson-S-D, Kurosky-A
Abstract: A small polypeptide within the molecular weight range of 6,000 to 11,000 was found in immunoglobulin fractions from sera of cystic fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygotes.  This factor appears to be responsible for interfering with ciliary activity in oyster gills. Since it can be dissociated from IgG without reductive cleavage it must be bound in a non-covalent manner.  After its dissociation the IgG fractions from cystic fibrosis sera no longer inhibited ciliary activity.  This finding explains the differences previously observed in the molecular weights of the ciliary inhibitor synthesized by cultured cells and that of sera from cystic fibrosis genotypes.

Title: Classification of hereditary disorders of sexual development
Authors: Wilson-J-D, Goldstein-J-L
Abstract: We have recently proposed a classification of the disorders of sexual development based upon the presumed site of action of the abnormal gene during embryogenesis.  These disorders, which may be either genetic or nongenetic in nature, are the result of disturbances in the physiology of sexual differentiation during embryogenesis.  The purpose of this review is to summarize the current physiologic concepts of normal sexual differentiation, to review the known hereditary disorders of sexual development, and to consider briefly the implications that these mutations have for the understanding of normal sexual differentiation.  The translation of genetic sex into phenotypic sex is a complex process.  Since some 19 hereditary, single-gene determined disorders of sexual development are currently recognized that involve loci on both the autosomes and the X chromosome, it can be inferred that at a minimum 19 genes and hence 19 discrete biochemical steps are involved in this process.  At least 10 mutations result in male pseudohermaphroditism, whereas only 2 mutations are known to cause female pseudohermaphroditism.  The predominance of male type of mutation is the result of the fact that the formation of the male phenotype is actively induced by the secretions of the fetal testis whereas the formation of the female phenotype does not require secretion from the fetal ovary.  The end result of these mutations that involve the formation and action of testosterone can be similar, and it requires anatomic, endocrinologic, and genetic study of individual patients to identify the mutant genes involved.  Undoubtedly, many more as yet unidentified genes must participate in sexual differentiation.  The identification of these genes will depend on the continued delineation of new simply inherited clinical syndromes.  Any fundamental understanding of the programming of events in phenotypic differentiation will require not only the identification of the genes involved but the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which each of these genes is expressed.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Zaidi-Z-H
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others suggest that estimation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) might help in detecting carriers in families at risk for cystic fibrosis.  Observers in the U.K. have been unable to confirm these findings, whereas Dr. J. A. Smith of New York supports them.  Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique of estimating serum AFP.  if a small number of families is analysed the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected. By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some may have all affected children.  For example, nowadays, since families tend to be small, the appearance of an autosomal recessive condition is often sporadic with only one affected person in the family.  This could well apply to cystic fibrosis.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Fitzsimmons-J-S, Smith-N, Hiller-E-J, Wynne-J
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others found raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a heterozygote carrier of the gene for cystic fibrosis and in patients with the disease and some of the siblings.  Our results do not show any significant difference in AFP levels in patients, siblings, parents, or control children. Probably the discrepancy in the findings will be explained by more detailed examination of the technique used.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Knopple-G, Rotthauwe-H-W, Lehmann-F-G
Abstract: Professor R. K. Chandra and others reported significantly increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), in the parents of the patients, and in some of their siblings in Newfoundland, Canada.  The serum AFP levels in our 38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults. In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Authors: No authors available
Abstract: Over the past 12 months we have examined by both counterimmunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay sera from (a) 37 patients with cystic fibrosis (age 6 months to 17 years), (b) 10 of their siblings, and (c) 24 of their parents for the presence of raised serum levels of AFP.  By counterimmunoelectrophoresis we were unable to detect an increased serum concentration of AFP in any of the cystic fibrosis patients or their relatives.  In addition, the results from the radioimmunoassay method showed that all of the cystic fibrosis patients and their relatives had normal concentrations of AFP in their serum. - Using a double antibody radioimmunoassay we found the mean serum AFP for seven children with cystic fibrosis to be little different from that of controls, while all seven values fell within the normal range for this series. - In seven patients considered to have cystic fibrosis on the basis of a sweat chloride level above 65 mmol/l the mean serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP level was 1825 (range 130 - 2360) microg/l. The corresponding level in the patients was 433 (range 80 - 1055) microg/l.  Drug therapy given to these patients may have a subtle hepatoxic influence, thereby causing a rise in AFP levels.  The severity of the disease does not influence the degree of elevation. There is a corresponding rise in carcinoembryonic antigen levels also, but the latter is related to the degree of tissue damage and results from the sero-cross-reactivity between mucus-producing respiratory mucosa and fetal tissues.

Title: Letter: Essential fatty acid deficiency due to artificial diet in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Dodge-J-A, Salter-D-G, Yassa-J-G
Abstract: We wish to draw the attention of your readers to a possible hazard of feeding infants with an elemental diet.  Considerable interest is currently being shown in the use of the artificial diet in cystic fibrosis.  It may be used as a supplement to ordinary food or to supply all the nutritional needs of the child.  In the latter event we believe that it is particularly important to emphasize to the parents the need for an additional source of dietary fat.  Clinical evidence and animal experiments suggest that infants, because of their rapid growth rate, are particularly at risk and that in the absence of dietary E.F.A. they will develop deficiency symptoms in about two months.

Title: Serum alpha - fetoprotein levels in patients with cystic fibrosis and their parents and siblings
Authors: Chandra-R-K, Madhavankutty-K, Way-R-C
Abstract: Patients with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) showed raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). A moderate but significant increase in serum AFP was present in their parents and some siblings. There was no correlation between the clinical severity of the disease and serum AFP concentration. Samples from control groups with gluten-induced malabsorption and bronchiectasis had normal levels. Persistent synthesis of AFP may be an associated marker of C.F. genes, and estimation of serum AFP might help in detecting heterozygote carriers in families at risk.

Title: Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Belanger-L, Hamel-D, Aubin-G, Belanger-M, Bigonesse-P, Dorval-J
Abstract: Sera from 40 well-confirmed cystic fibrosis patients and 60 of their parents were obtained through two Canadian (Chicoutimi and Quebec) and one United States (San Diego) cystic fibrosis clinics.  AFP was measured by two methods: a double antibody enzyme immunoassay and a sodium sulphate precipitation radioimmunoassay.  Our results thus confirm that serum AFP levels are normal in cystic fibrosis.

Title: Immune complexes in cystic fibrosis
Authors: McFarlane-H, Holzel-A, Brenchley-P, Allan-J-D, Wallwork-J-C
Abstract: Circulating immune complexes were detected in serum and sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (C.F.).  There were extensive deposits of immunoglobulins and complement immune complexes in several of the C.F. organs, especially the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but not in the kidneys.  Significant concentrations of IgG and of complement complexes could be eluted from the lungs of the C.F. patients but not from those of controls.  Studies involving immunoabsorption, autoradiography, and molecular sieving through Sephadex G-200 columns identified both bovine serum albumin and staphylococcal alpha-haemolysin as two of the antigens present in the immune complexes.  The sedimentation constant of the immune complexes was about 8S to 11S.  The clinical significance of these immune complexes and the wide variety of antibodies detected in C.F. patients are discussed.

Title: Anaesthetic management of volume controlled unilateral lung lavage
Authors: Blenkarn-G-D, Lanning-C-F, Kylstra-J-A
Abstract: Conventional means to facilitate clearance of inspissated material obstructing gas exchange in the alveoli and finer airways of patients with alveolar proteinosis, asthma, and mucoviscidosis, are often not very effective.  The mechanical removal of such materials by volume controlled unilateral lung lavage with saline has been of benefit in selected patients refractory to conventional therapy (particularly those with alveolar proteinosis or accidentally inhaled radioactive particles).  This report describes the anaesthetic and lavage techniques currently used in managing patients with alveolar proteinosis and mucoviscidosis and in whom lung lavage repeated at approximately six-month intervals has resulted in both subjective and objective improvements.  In 14 lavages in four different patients (10 lavages in two patients with alveolar proteinosis and four lavages in two patients with mucoviscidosis) certain physiologic responses to lung lavage, particularly those related to oxygen transport, were measured quantitatively in an attempt to evaluate and to optimize anaesthetic and lavage techniques.  The maintenance anaesthetic during lavage was selected randomly, so that each patient received light anaesthesia with ketamine/diazepam during one lavage and light halothane anaesthesia during lavage of the contralateral lung.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: present status and future prospects in detection of patients and carriers
Authors: Forstner-G, Crozier-D-N, Sturgess-J-M
Abstract: Development of a sensitive, easily performed, reliable test would be an important advance in detecting cystic fibrosis, improving genetic counselling and providing early effective treatment. The sweat chloride test, which is reliable in diagnosis, is technically too difficult for a screening program, and only reliably detects homozygotes. In contrast, the meconium test for detecting homozygote newborns is simple, inexpensive, reasonably specific but its general application has yet to be evaluated. Detection of serum components is the basis of two new tests to distinguish patients with cystic fibrosis and carriers. The effect of these serum components on ciliary activity is the principle of one test, an extremely difficult procedure that is subjective and lacks sufficient specificity for routine use. The second test, in which serum components are separated by isoelectric focusing, may provide an objective biochemical means of detecting both homozygotes and heterozygotes.

Title: Cystic fibrosis
Authors: Marcotte-A-A
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis, whether it is called fibrocystic disease of the pancreas, mucoviscidosis, of simply C.F., is a condition that currently afflicts one in every 2,500 children.  A glimpse of this disease is gained through the experience of Amelia, one of its victims.

Title: Volume-controlled lung lavage in a woman with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Lober-C-W, Saltzman-H-A, Kylstra-J-A
Abstract: A 22-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis was treated by volume- controlled lavage of each of her lungs on two occasions. Following the first lavages, the patient's vital capacity increased by 1.03 liters and her 1-sec forced expiratory volume increased by 0.70 liters/second. Similar improvements, although less pronounced, were noted after both lungs has been lavaged a second time. It is concluded that volume-controlled lung lavage can be of benefit as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Title: Cystic fibrosis--immunological reactions to A. fumigatus and common allergens
Authors: Warren-C-P, Tai-E, Batten-J-C, Hutchcroft-B-J, Pepys-J
Abstract: Immunological studies of forty-three patients with cystic fibrosis showed that positive prick tests to at least one common allergen were obtained in 70%, to multiple allergens in 28% and to A. fumigatus in 50%. Specific IgE antibodies against these allergens were found in the appropriate subjects. In spite of this evidence of type 1, IgE, sensitization none of the patients had a history of infantile eczema. Intracutaneous tests with A. fumigatus extract gave types 1 and 3 reactions in sixteen patients (37%), only seven of whom were among the sixteen (37%) who gave positive precipitin tests. Raised levels of total serum IgG and IgA were found as compared with healthy controls and asthmatic subjects. No differences were found in total serum IgM and IgD levels. The high incidence of allergy to A. fumigatus in cystic fibrosis is confirmed.

Title: Immediate hypersensitivity in patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Allan-J-D, Moss-A-D, Wallwork-J-C, McFarlane-H
Abstract: Twenty-three out of thirty patients with cystic fibrosis gave strong immediate skin hypersensitivity reaction to a wide variety of allergens. Seventy-five per cent of these had a markedly elevated serum IgE concentration whereas those patients who had negative Type 1 immediate skin reactions also had normal levels of serum IgE. The sputum of those patients with immediate skin reactivity also had positive precipitins to a variety of antigens.

Title: Polyamine alterations in blood of male homozygotes and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis
Authors: Lundgren-D-W, Farrell-P-M, Di-SantAgnese-P-A
Abstract: The polyamines, spermidine and spermine, have been measured in whole blood extracts from control volunteers, patients with cystic fibrosis, and obligate cystic fibrosis heterozygotes. Male homo- and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis exhibit a consistent and significant decrease in blood spermine resulting in an elevated spermidine/spermine ratio when compared to control males. In contrast, control females exhibited reduced spermidine and spermine levels as compared to control males. Blood from female cystic fibrosis homo- and heterozygotes showed similar results. The sex difference is probably due to fluctuations of blood polyamines during the menstrual cycle. Abnormal polyamine levels are the first observation of an alteration of a low molecular weight metabolite characteristic of both male homo- and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis.

Title: Copper analysis of nail clippings.  An attempt to differentiate between normal children and patients suffering from cystic fibrosis
Authors: van-Stekelenburg-G-J, van-de-Laar-AJB, van-der-Laag-J
Abstract: From 39 normal children and 36 patients, suffering from cystic fibrosis (C/F), the copper content of finger nail clippings and toe nail clippings were determined. From this study it can be concluded that, although the patients with cystic fibrosis (C/F) have a higher copper content, the determination of copper in nail samples cannot be used in order to differentiate between normal children and patients. Also higher mean copper concentrations were found in finger nail clippings in comparison with toe nails. This difference was significant for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Title: Alpha-1-antitrypsin in duodenal fluid and gallbladder bile
Authors: Kyaw-Myint-T-O, Howell-A-M, Murphy-G-M, Anderson-C-M
Abstract: Using the immunoelectrophoretic method alpha-1-antitrypsin was detected in all but 6 of 26 samples of duodenal fluid obtained from 16 patients with various gastroenterological problems. The concentrations (mg/100 ml) of alpha-1-antitrypsin in duodenal aspirates from children with liver disease (7.32 plus or minus 6.1) were less than those from children with cystic fibrosis, Shwachman Diamond syndrome, or Hirschsprung's disease (16.7 plus or minus 11.9; p smaller than 0.02). Alpha-1-antitrypsin was detected in all but one of 6 samples of gallbladder bile, the exception being that from a patient with extrahepatic biliary atresia. No significant correlation was found between the alpha-1-antitrypsin concentration in the samples studied and the corresponding total antitrypsin activity.

Title: A simple method for the quantitative determination of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin
Authors: Robinson-P-G, Smith-P-A, Elliott-R-B
Abstract: A simple method for the determination of the activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin in stool and duodenal aspirations is described.  The method is based on that described by Barbero et al. (Am. J. Dis. Child., 112 (1966) 536) [1] but utilizes the time for a drop of 0.1 pH unit in the solution, instead of a constant pH titration, to determine enzyme activity.  Results for a number of cystic fibrosis patients and normals compare favorably with the literature.

Title: Screening for cystic fibrosis by analysis of meconium for albumin and protease inhibitors
Authors: Ryley-H-C, Neale-L-M, Brogan-T-D, Bray-P-T
Abstract: A qualitative method of detecting elevated meconium protein concentration was compared with a method of determining meconium albumin concentration by electroimmunoassay since elevated meconium protein levels can indicate pancreatic insufficiency caused by cystic fibrosis. Between 5 and 10 per 1000 healthy infants passed meconium specimens that gave a false positive reaction with the Boehringer Mannheim test strip and contained a greater than expected concentration of albumin.  It was possible to exclude pancreatic insufficiency in all of these children by determining the ratio, albumin : alpha1-antitrypsin in meconium and subsequent faecal specimens, since it was found that values of this ratio in excess of 2.0 suggested pancreatic insufficiency of the type associated with cystic fibrosis. Three of 14 neonates with subsequently proven cystic fibrosis yielded meconium specimens giving negative test strip results and low albumin concentrations. In two of these patients, the ratio, albumin : alpha1-antitrypsin in the meconium was within normal limits but, within two months of birth, the albumin : alpha1- antitrypsin ratio in the faeces of both children was greater than 3.0 suggesting that pancreatic insufficiency had developed.

Title: Cystic fibrosis heterozygote detection: a study on a normal population
Authors: Danes-B-S
Abstract: Detection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) heterozygote by testing for cystic fibrosis factor activity (CFFA) in serum samples using bioassays had been reported to give unreliable results. The present study was undertaken to find whether the use of medium from short term white blood cell or skin fibroblast cultures, rather than serum, as the test sample would eliminate such inconsistencies. Short term white blood cell cultures were established from 107 normal, healthy individuals. Cultures from 97 had no CFFA, six (No. 1-6) showed variable results and four (No. 7-10) had activity in all four tests done on a single sample. When the assays were repeated 3 months later on new cultures from these four positive CFFA individuals, two showed activity (Nos. 7 & 9) and two did not (Nos. 8 & 10). All 10 individuals whose cultures showed CFFA has histories of allergies. The association of CFFA in the culture medium derived from individuals having allergies with the intermittent presence of this activity suggested that environmental factors induced a CFF-like activity in such white blood cell cultures. The oyster ciliary assay, using medium from white blood cell cultures, cannot be used for screening for the CF heterozygote since the substitution of culture medium for serum did not eliminate inconsistent results and CFFA was not specific by this assay for the CF gene. Of the fibroblast lines established from the four persons whose initial white blood cell cultures consistently showed CFFA, only one (No. 7) showed the CF culture phenotype (CFFA positive and metachromasia).

Title: Cystic fibrosis heterozygote detection: a family study
Authors: Danes-B-S, Beck-B, Flensborg-E-W
Abstract: Family studies have been done to determine if the phenotypes described for the cystic fibrosis (CF) cultured cell reliably detected the CF gene. Two culture phenotypes were studied in culture derived from consecutive generations in four CF families: (1) cystic fibrosis factor (CFF) in the medium of short-term white blood cell cultures assayed by a modified oyster ciliary test and (2) the three characteristics of cultured skin fibroblasts (metachromasia without alcianophilia at 0.3 M MgCl2, CFF in the culture medium and metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts). As CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, the family offered a test unit for determining the specificity of these cell phenotypes for the CF gene. On the basis of detecting the CF culture phenotypes in the homozygote and obligatory heterozygotes, the parents, and their segregation in consecutive generations, detection of the CF gene was not possible in the white blood cell cultures, but was possible in the skin fibroblast cultures.

Title: Pulmonary diseases in childhood
Authors: Ho-Shin-Y, Glass-L, Evans-H-E
Abstract: Many types of lung disease are seen in the pediatric age group. These range all the way from disorders of the neonate that are closely related to parturition, to acute infectious diseases seen in infancy and early childhood, to chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and bronchial asthma.  Management of the conditions described involves cooperation between the primary care physician and the specialist.  A variety of organizations offers aid to both physicians and patients' families.

Title: The management of cystic fibrosis.  Observations on gentamycin when used with other antibiotics in pulmonary infections associated with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Shwachman-H, Khaw-K-T, Kowalski-S-M
Abstract: From 1971 to 1973, we hospitalized 41 symptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis for intensive pulmonary therapy.  The more severely ill patients were admitted more than once during this period.  Our study included 100 courses of such intensive treatment.  Garamycin pediatric injectable, containing 10 mg/ml of the active ingredient, was administered intravenously to all patients in divided doses of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of garamycin when administered parenterally to cystic fibrosis patients with serious infections.  During the 100 courses of treatment, clinical improvement was rated as follows: significant or definite improvement, 39; moderate improvement, 50; slight improvement, 9; and no change, 2.  The use of garamycin pediatric injectable is safe and can be helpful in the management of the pulmonary infectious complications of cystic fibrosis when employed along with other well-established modalities of therapy.

Title: The psychosocial approach to the medical management of patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Grossman-M-L
Abstract: It is most important to deal with the feelings of the child and his family in regard to cystic fibrosis.  Genuine recognition of feelings by the pediatric staff can go a long way toward reassuring family members that their long-standing burden and suffering are being validated and understood.  When a family manifests early signs of difficulty in coping with the emotional and physical stress imposed by cystic fibrosis, it is helpful to refer them to a child psychiatrist for consultation.  It is primarily the families at high risk for breakdown which most require early prevention and intervention.  The role of the pediatrician as the primary clinician is crucial.  It is he who must provide the support and understanding that are integral parts of the primary prevention of emotional decompensation in this disorder.

Title: Cor pulmonale in children

Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, chronic cor pulmonale is defined as "hypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from diseases affecting the function and/or the structure of the lung, except when these pulmonary alterations are the result of diseases that primarily affect the left side of the heart or of congenital heart disease."  Cor pulmonale has been extensively studied and reported in adults, but it has received relatively little attention in the pediatric age group.  Although some parts of knowledge gained from adult studies can be used, chronic cor pulmonale in children and infants is quite a different entity from that usually seen in adults. This review is primarily an attempt to clarify some of the confusion surrounding this subject and to focus on the pediatric aspects. Pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed.

Title: Classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia in cystic fibrosis correlated with lung function tests
Authors: Lykkegaard-E, Pedersen-J-T
Abstract: Lung function tests were conducted in 35 patients with cystic fibrosis and correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia. Seven patients belonged to class I (vesticular metachromasia), 16 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 12 to class III (no metachromasia).  Class I patients had significantly lower vital capacity (VC) than class II patients.  As regards the other lung function tests, no general trends were found in class I patients compared with the other two classes.  For class III patients the lung function tests reflected more serious lung changes than those of class II patients; statistically significant differences were found as regards residual volume/total lung capacity, one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and FEV1/VC.  The differences were not due to varying intensity of treatment.  The results are in accordance with the findings in a previous study of the clinical and radiological lung symptoms and serum protein values in CF when correlated to metachromatic classes.

Title: Classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia in cystic fibrosis correlated with growth parameters
Authors: Lykkegaard-E
Abstract: Metachromasia of cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the assignment of the fibroblasts to one of three classes after the morphological distribution of the metachromatic staining, have been described by Danes and Bearn (1968, 1969) and Danes (1969).  In two previous studies from this hospital (Lykkegaard & Jacobsen 1975, Lykkegaard & Thuesen Pedersen 1975) the clinical, radiological, and functional severity of the lung disease and the serum protein pattern in CF patients were studied in relation to classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia.  It was found that class III patients tended to be more severely affected than class II patients, and more than class I + II patients, and, possibly, class I patients were also more severely affected than class II patients.  Sproul and Huang (1964), in a study of growth patterns in cystic fibrosis, found a significant correlation between severity of the respiratory disease and height and weight retardation.  In the present study, height and weight development in 98 CF patients are correlated with class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.

Title: Classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia in cystic fibrosis correlated with clinical parameters
Authors: Lykkegaard-E, Jacobsen-L
Abstract: A retrospective study of clinical and radiological lung symptoms and intensity of treatment of 98 patients with cystic fibrosis was conducted.  The results were correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.  Fourteen patients belonged to class I (vesicular metachromasia), 52 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 32 to class III (no metachromasia).  All patients above 16 years of age (six patients) were class II.  Simple scoring systems for clinical lung symptoms and for treatment of lung disease were developed.  When compared at the same ages, class I and III patients were more severely affected (judged by the clinical lung symptoms) than class II patients, and they had been more intensively treated.  Comparing class I + II patients (metachromatic fibroblasts) with class III patients (ametachromatic fibroblasts), it was found that class III patients were more severely affected and had been more intensively treated than class I + II patients.  As regards chest radiographs (judged by Norman's system) a similar pattern was seen, but no statistically significant differences were found.  In 68 patients (9 of class I, 35 of class II, and 24 of class III) the serum protein electrophoretic fractions were studied.  It was found that class III patients had more severe alterations than class II patients, and more than class I + II patients.  The proportion of female patients in class III was greater than in the other two classes, but this could not explain the differences.  Because of the small number of patients in class I, the differences between class I and class II patients are more doubtful than the differences between class III and class II patients, or between class III and class I + II patients.

Title: Immunoperoxidase demonstration of human serum globulin binding to islet tissue
Authors: Sorenson-R-L, Shank-R-D, Elde-R-P
Abstract: Sera from juvenile diabetic and nondiabetic controls were tested, using the immunoperoxidase method, for the presence of islet-binding immunoglobulins. All diabetic sera tested contained an islet-binding protein and on the average the sera were more positive than age- matched controls. Normal adult sera are undifferentiated from juvenile diabetic sera. Most sera from children less than two years of age did not bind to islet tissue and sera from cystic fibrosis patients had a markedly diminished ability to bind to islet tissue. The binding protein appears to be an immunoglobulin which selectively reacts with elements of the islet beta cell.

Title: Excretion of trypsin-like activity, electrolytes and protein in mixed and parotid saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas
Authors: Schoni-M, Kaiser-D, Drack-E, Axmacher-U
Abstract: The esterolytic activity of mixed and parotid saliva in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and normal subjects was determined using BAEE (alpha-Benzoyl-1-arginine-ethylester) as the substrate. Using soybean- trypsin-inhibitor the trypsin-like activity (TLA) was measured and plotted as a function of parotid flow rate. In addition calcium, protein and pH were determined. Trypsin-like activity in mixed and parotid saliva showed large individual variations in CF and normal children. In parotid saliva we could not find any significant difference, whereas a reduction of TLA in mixed saliva of CF patients was observed. The fact that our normal values fell within the range of heterozygotes reported by Rao et al. (19), makes their hypothesis of a close relationship between reduced TLA and the genetic defect very doubtful. Protein, calcium and pH increased with augmented salivation and no difference between CF patients and normal age matched children could be found except for the pH at a flow rate above 0.75 ml/min per m2 body surface where significantly lower pH values resulted. The relevance of reduced TLA to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis is discussed.

Title: Screening for genetic disorders
Authors: Berry-H-K
Abstract: The past 50 years in developed countries have seen a steady decline in infant mortality from diseases associated with infections and malnutrition.  During the period the contribution from genetic diseases and congenital malformations has risen significantly. Genetically oriented screening programs have a high potential to contribute to the overall improvement of health in both developed and underdeveloped countries.  In this review only procedures for screening for hereditary biochemical disorders will be considered. Criteria for selection of genetic traits to be screened, the schedule for screening, specimens for screening, the screening of newborn infants, the testing of older infants, the testing of high-risk infants and children, the screening of families with genetic diseases, and screening for carriers in selected populations are discussed.

Title: Parathenar palmar pattern: a dermatoglyphic sign of possible clinical significance
Authors: Hook-E-B, Bonenfant-R
Abstract: The frequency of a 'double proximal axial triradius' (DPAT), which results in a palmar parathenar pattern, has been reported to be increased in those with ventricular septal defect (BSD). We scored the presence of this pattern in 313 patients with congenital heart defects (including 86 with isolated VSD), 176 with cystic fibrosis (CF) or relatives of those with CF, and 333 with no known clinical disease who were unrelated to individuals with CF. The frequencies in these three groups were 1.6, 2.3, and 0.6%, respectively. None of those with isolated VSD defect had a DPAT. All five individuals in the heart defect group with a DPAT had pulmonic stenosis. Of the total of eleven individuals in our series with DPAT patterns, eight were affected only on the right hand. The frequency of DPAT in individuals with no known disease in this series was 4/406=1.0%, more than double the frequency in a control series, published previously by DAVID, 5/1,129=0.4%. If the 73 relatives of those with CF are excluded from our own 'control' group, the frequency of DPAT in this group is then 0.6%, closer to the results in DAVID's control series.

Title: Demonstration of a factor in the serum of homozygotes and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis by a non-biological technique
Authors: Altland-K, Schmidt-S-R, Kaiser-G, Knoche-W
Abstract: A factor has been isolated from serum of homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis using isoelectric focusing and disc electrophoresis as analytical methods.  The factor is focused within an IgG-fraction with an isoelectric point of pH 8 to 9 but differs from IgG in its lower molecular weight.  It is thus similar to, if not identical with, the ciliary dyskinesia factor.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: involvement of the ear, nose, and paranasal sinuses
Authors: Cunningham-D-G, Gatti-W-M, Eitenmiller-A-M, Van-Gorder-P-N
Abstract: Twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis all exhibited disease of the paranasal sinuses, consisting of opacification of the maxillary sinuses either alone or as part of a parasinusitis.  Symptoms of sinusitis seldom occurred and treatment was not generally required. Agenesis or delayed development of frontal sinuses was also seen in the majority of patients.  Nasal polyps occurred in 27% of the patients, all of whom were over five years of age.  Excluding those patients under five years of age, none of whom had polyps, the incidence was 36%.  In general, polyps were not observed in those patients with severe disease.  Mild degrees of conductive hearing loss were noted in the younger age groups especially, but no instance of severe hearing loss or nerve conduction disturbance was encountered.  Such mild degrees of hearing loss may merely reflect the application of standards too stringent for this age group. Throat and nose cultures on 26 patients revealed pseudomonas aeruginosa in eighteen cases, reflecting the flora of the tracheobronchial tree.  Other organisms were encountered on an unpredictable basis with findings consistent with those anticipated in this age group of patients.

Title: Clinical aspects of iron absorption and turnover.  pp.  34-61
Authors: Heinrich-H-C
Abstract: The diagnostic 10 micro-mole (0.56 mg) 59Fe2 absorption whole body retention test (Fig. 1) has now been in use for 10 years for the detection of depleted iron stores in subjects with iron deficiency (Heinrich et al., 1966; Heinrich and Bartels, 1967).  Further studies were necessary to investigate the clinical reliability of increased 59Fe2 absorption in patients with erythroblastic hyperplasia, which may control the regulation of iron absorption by iron stores.  The relationship between iron absorption and iron stores was studied in pancreatic insufficiency to reinvestigate the effect of pancreatic secretion on iron absorption.  Iron absorption in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy was investigated in order to correlate the impairment of iron absorption with the degree of villous atrophy and to study its recovery on a gluten-free diet. Dietary iron absorption was measured in patients with gastric mucosal atrophy and partial gastrectomy to investigate the extent to which iron malabsorption is responsible for the high incidence of iron deficiency in such patients.  The combination of the diagnostic 59Fe2 absorption test and measurement of the whole body 59Fe2 elimination rate is a useful routine procedure for the detection and quantification of gastrointestinal or urogenital blood loss as a cause of iron deficiency.

Title: Alpha-fetoprotein in serum and amniotic fluid in the diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis syndrome, Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, ataxia telangiectasia and spina bifida
Authors: Chandra-R-K
Abstract: Alpha-fetoprotein (A.F.P.) was detected and quantitated by the methods of immunodiffusion in agarose, counterimmunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay.  Serum A.F.P. level was raised in patients and siblings of Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis homozygotes heterozygotes, neonatal hepatitis and ataxia telangiectasia.  It was mildly elevated in biliary atresia.  In women with previous history of a child with severe neural tube defect, raised amniotic fluid levels of A.F.P. were associated with anencephaly or spina bifida. The diagnostic utility of A.F.P. in pediatrics, especially in genetic counselling, is discussed.

Title: Concentration of gentamicin in bronchial secretions of children with cystic fibrosis of tracheostomy.  (Comparison between the intramuscular route, the endotracheal instillation and aerosolization)
Authors: Baran-D, Dachy-A, Klastersky-J
Abstract: The levels of gentamicin in blood and in secretions of the tracheobronchial tree were measured in 14 children (8 with cystic fibrosis and 6 with tracheostomy) in a cross over fashion after the administration of 40 mg of gentamicin by aerosol or by endotracheal injection. High levels of gentamicin (greater than 20 mug/ml) within the bronchial secretions were observed in 7 children after aerosolization and in 11 children after endotracheal instillation. Corresponding blood levels were low (less than 3 mug/ml) in all patients and no detectable levels were found in 10 children after aerosolization and in 6 children after endotracheal instillation. No significant differences were observed between children with cystic fibrosis and those with tracheostomy. Since intramuscular injection of gentamicin (a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg) resulted in low levels of gentamicin within the bronchial secretions (less than 2 mug/ml in 10 patients, among whom 4 had undetectable levels); it is concluded that the administration of an antibiotic such as gentamicin, directly to the trachea by endotracheal injection or by aerosolization might prove to be helpful when the infection is confined mainly to the tracheo-bronchial tree.

Title: Application of the cilia dyskinesis test in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in an adolescent
Authors: Arad-I, Lafair-J-S, Shapira-E
Abstract: In certain cases of obscure chronic lung disease, the possibility of a genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, should be considered. When the genetic defect fails to cause pancreatic involvement, the partial expression of cystic fibrosis is encountered. Elevation of sweat electrolyte levels is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults since normal levels vary widely in both adolescents and adults. Other tests should, therefore, be utilized. The cilia dyskinesis test is positive in both homozygous and heterozygous patients with cystic fibrosis. Utilization of this technique in a family study confirmed the diagnosis of partial expression of cystic fibrosis in an adolescent female.

Title: Absorption of two antibacterial drugs, cephalexin and co-trimoxazole, in malabsorption syndromes
Authors: Parsons-R-L, Paddock-G-M
Abstract: Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of cephalexin, trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) were measured in normal subjects and in patients with coeliac disease, small bowel diverticulosis, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis (cephalexin only) and after administration of cholestyramine.  The absorption of cephalexin was improved in coeliac disease diverticulosis and cystic fibrosis.  In Crohn's disease the peak plasma level was reduced and delayed.  The absorption of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole was increased in all three conditions.  However there was a disproportionate increase in the plasma level of trimethoprim in coeliac disease and diverticulosis when compared with that of sulphamethoxazole.  In Crohn's disease there was a threefold increase in the peak plasma level of sulphamethoxazole.  After cholestyramine administration there was malabsorption of all three drugs.

Title: Heterogeneity of the carbohydrate chains of sulfated bronchial glycoproteins isolated from a patient suffering from cystic fibrosis
Authors: Roussel-P, Lamblin-G, Degand-P
Abstract: Sulfated glycoproteins having blood group H activity were isolated from the sputum of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis, by reduction of the fibrillar mucus, chromatography on ECTEOLA- cellulose, and gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. The sulfated glycoproteins were degraded with alkaline borohydride, and the degradation products were fractionated by chromatography on ion exchange resins and by gel filtration. The carbohydrate chains thus obtained have a wide heterogeneity with regard to acidity and molecular size. The neutral chains contain blood group H active oligosaccharides and incomplete chains as short as 1 residue of 2- acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose. The minimal size of the neuraminic acid-containing chains is less than that of the sulfated chains, which increases with the degree of sulfation. The sulfate groups are linked at C-6 at the D-galactose residues.

Title: Tropomyosin antibody: the specific localization of tropomyosin in nonmuscle cells
Authors: Lazarides-E
Abstract: An antibody against purified chicken skeletal muscle tropomyosin is used in indirect immunofluorescence to visualize the localization of tropomyosin in a variety of nonmuscle cells. The antibody produces a fluorescent pattern which is very similar to that obtained with an actin-specific antibody. This pattern is composed of fluorescent fibers which are shown to be coincident with the fibers seen with phase-contrast optics. High resolution epifluorescent microscopy reveals that fibers stained with the actin antibody show a continuous fluorescence, while fibers reacted with the tropomyosin antibody show a periodic fluorescence. Measurements indicate that the lengths of the fluorescent segments are variable with an average of 1.2 mum while the spacing between segments is approximately 0.4 mum.

Title: Survival patterns in cyctic fibrosis
Authors: Warwick-W-J, Pogue-R-E, Gerber-H-U, Nesbitt-C-J
Abstract: This paper describes the Data Registry System of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  Through this system an annual up-dated and corrected data base has been prepared for cystic fibrosis patients seen at U.S.A. Centers from 1966 through 1972.  From the data base, a large number of life table studies are calculated.  A study is specified by its data base, the observation period, analysis age (age year or year since diagnosis), the Centers included, and the condition of patients at birth, and possible additional factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, or race.  The annual rates of mortality are measured by a force of mortality technique.  Two techniques have been used to appraise the mortality of particular groups, graphing the cumulative survival function for the group together with the cumulative survival function for a comparative group, and calculation of mortality ratios of actual to expected deaths (by an applicable standard mortality table).  This latter approach lends itself readily to tests of significance.  For the purpose of calculating mortality ratios, two standard tables have been prepared on the basis of the 1972 Data Base and the 1966-1972 observations.  The first of these standard tables is for use with age year studies, and the second is for years since diagnosis studies.  The paper comments on the number of mortality studies by calendar year, by sex, by condition at birth, by age at diagnosis, and of survival from diagnosis of patients diagnosed in 1966-1972.  The calendar year studies indicate an improvement trend in the survival experience from 1966 to 1972 but a change may be occurring.  The study by sex exhibits a higher female mortality.  The 7% of patients who have meconium ileus at birth show a significantly higher first-year mortality, and a somewhat lower survival rate thereafter even if the first year of life experience is excluded.  Mortality data for groups specified by age at diagnosis are given.  For patients diagnosed during 1966-1972, there is some indication of better survival than for patients diagnosed prior to 1966.  The continuation of these mortality studies on an annual basis should further our understanding of survival patterns for cystic fibrosis patients.

Title: Urinary excretion of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in normal children and those with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Murad-F, Moss-W-W, Johanson-J, Selden-R-F
Abstract: The urinary excretion of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was examined in 98 normal children and 46 children with cystic fibrosis between the ages of 9 months and 18 yr. Diurnal variations in cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion were observed in subjects from either group, and peak levels of cyclic nucleotide excretion were generally observed during the period of 0700 to 2100 h. Excretion rates (mumol/day) of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP increased significantly with age. When cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion rates were normalized for urinary creatine, or body weight, the values declined significantly with age in both groups of patients. Cyclic GMP excretion normalized for body surface area also decreased with age, while the value for cyclic AMP (2.86 plus or minus 0.08 mumol/day/m2, mean plus or minus SE) was constant with age in both normals and cystic fibrosis children. With some comparisons of age groups there were significant differences in cyclic nucleotide excretion between normal subjects and children with cystic fibrosis. The differences noted were dependent upon the methods used to normalize excretion rates (urinary creatine, body weight, surface area, and the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted). In general patients with cystic fibrosis excreted greater amounts of cyclic GMP than did normals. The most striking comparison was the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted which was 9.09 plus or minus 0.50 in all normal children and 4.41 plus or minus 0.32 in children with cystic fibrosis (P smaller than 0.001).

Title: Serotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas
Authors: Zierdt-C-H, Williams-R-L
Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (173) from 144 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas in seven hospitals were serotyped with the agglutination systems of Homma (1974) and Fisher et al. (1969). The two systems were complementary. Strains from CF patients were much less likely to furnish a stable type on repetitive typing tests than strains from other patients. This was related to the frequent occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8) capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60%) CF strains. Eight serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units. The CF serotype comprised from 50 to 93% of CF strains in the seven hospitals. These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid, nonmucoid, rough) as separate strains was erroneous. Repetitive typing with the two systems gave better results than a single system. The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in the CF patient. It is not known why the mucoid CF strain has a peculiar predilection for CF patients, nor why it generally loses the quality in culture but retains it indefinitely in the patient.

Title: The source of Na+ and Cl- activities on the skin surface. Experiences with electrode measurements in children
Authors: Green-M, Mascia-A-V, Behrendt-H
Abstract: We have used ion-specific electrodes in an attempt to map the sodium and chloride activities on the skin under differing surface conditions. The range of values and the standard deviations are so wide that a baseline for the untreated dry skin is precluded. In patients with cystic fibrosis, a wide range of values is also found. For this group, measurements on dry skin taken immediately after washing were in the same low range as for healthy subjects. The range of measurements on the dry skin of newborn infants was similar for full-term infants with reactive sweat glands and for premature infants who failed to show sweating responsiveness to natural reflex stimulation as well as local glandular stimulation with sudorific drugs. For only two conditions have measurements of sodium and chloride activities on the surface of the skin been of value: (1) on the sweat-covered skin for the detection of the high values encountered in cystic fibrosis, and (2) on the dry skin surface, deprived of autonomic innervation (spinal paraplegia), extremely low sodium and chloride activities reflect absent gland activity.

Title: Alpha-feto-protein during development and in disease
Authors: Adinolfi-A, Adinolfi-M, Lessof
Abstract: An alpha-feto-protein (AFP) is present in many mammals, in birds, and in sharks during development. The AFP present in different species have similar physicochemical properties and often have common antigenic determinants. Their study, both in health and disease, has provided a useful model for the understanding of other phase-specific antigens and the activation of the genes which control their synthesis. In the human fetus, the level of AFP falls with increasing maturity. The more sensitive methods of detection have disclosed that this fetal protein persists in trace amounts throughout life and its level increases in maternal blood during pregnancy. The principal sites of synthesis are the fetal liver and in some mammals, the yolk sac splanchnopleur. In humans as well as in mice and cows, it is notable that the synthesis of AFP is increased in liver cancer cells and that high levels of this protein are present in serum. Elevated values of AFP have also been detected in human subjects with undifferentiated tumours of the testis and ovary. A fall to normal levels has been noted in cases of complete remission after surgery and a return to high levels in patients who develop metastases. In some patients with hepatitis a temporary rise in the level of AFP has also been observed. In recent years, the detection of high levels of AFP in amniotic fluid has proved to be of great value for the prenatal diagnosis of neural-tube defects. Abnormal levels have also been found in the amniotic fluid or in maternal serum in cases of spontaneous abortion. Such measurements are now being assessed as a method of monitoring abnormal pregnancy.

Title: The search for relevant cell culture research in cystic fibrosis: one researcher's opinion
Authors: Danes-B-S
Abstract: Recently there has been a plethora of research approaches using cell culture to study cystic fibrosis.  Although these efforts can be lauded as attempts to understand one of the most common genetic disorders affecting the Caucasian population, such research should be relevant to the clinical entity known as cystic fibrosis.  The ultimate objectives of this research should be to determine the, as yet unknown, basic defect and to develop an assay for heterozygote detection.

Title: Mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: the influence of culture medium on the stability of mucus production
Authors: Govan-J-R
Abstract: Mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), those obtained from non-CF patients, and those obtained in vitro by the action of phage, were found to be stable in their mucoid colonial form when serially subcultured on deoxycholate-citrate agar. The ability of anionic, cationic and neutral surfactants to stabilise mucus production is described. The possible importance of dipalmitoyl lecithin as a stabilising agent for mucus production in vivo is considered, with particular reference to the role of mucoid P. aeruginosa in CF disease.

Title: Hepatic changes in young infants with cystic fibrosis: possible relation to focal biliary cirrhosis
Authors: Oppenheimer-E-H, Esterly-J-R
Abstract: Focal biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon finding in infants with cystic fibrosis, but it is present in more than a fifth of surviving children and adolescents. It was found at postmortem examination in only five of 47 infants with CF younger than 3 months, in five of 32 infants from 3 to 12 months, and in 18 of 67 children older than 1 year. In infants under 3 months, excessive mucus in intrahepatic bile ducts was seen in 11 necropsies; in 15 others there were only nonspecific periportal changes. Cholestasis was found in the livers of 18 of the 26 infants. Excessive mucus in the biliary tree was occasionally associated with periportal changes and cholestasis in older infants. The periportal changes, which are regarded as nonspecific, were never found in infants more than 1 year of age.

Title: Letter: Vocal cord paralysis in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Scanlin-T-F, Shapiro-R-S, Rosenlund-M-L
Abstract: Many conditions have been reported to cause vocal cord paralysis. To our knowledge cystic fibrosis has not been described as one of these conditions.  A 15-year-old white male with cystic fibrosis, who has been treated at our hospital, reported hoarseness of two week's duration on a routine clinic visit in March, 1973.  In March, 1974, mirror laryngoscopy revealed a paralysis of the left vocal cord in the paramedian position, consistent with paralysis of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.  It is felt that the vocal cord paralysis in this patient with cystic fibrosis is due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by an enlarged pulmonary artery.

Title: Taste correlates of disease states: cystic fibrosis
Authors: Desor-J-A, Maller-O
Abstract: The purpose here was to test for a generalized abnormal sensitivity of the external chemoreceptive systems using a standardized method that separates sensory activity from biasing factors known to affect measurement of sensitivity.  The frequency distributions of salt taste sensitivity for patients with cystic fibrosis are given. Normal siblings and control patients did not differ statistically, and they were combined into a single control group for analyses.  The patients with cystic fibrosis did not differ as a group from the normal subjects in salt sensitivity.  There were, however, two children with cystic fibrosis with taste sensitivities well below those observed among the normal children.  No age or sex differences in sensitivity were observed.  The taste sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis did not correlate with the Shwachman and Kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease.  Of the seven children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of taste testing, three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for measurements.  Patients with cystic fibrosis, as a group, were not found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal.  This corroborates the findings of Wotman and associates and strongly suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis.  Henkin and Powell hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in the concentration of electrolytes in sweat.  This seems unlikely since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis, yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range.  Wotman and associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive systems.  The clinical ratings of the severity of the disease did not correlate with taste sensitivity.

Title: Plasma membrane components of skin fibroblasts from normal individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Baig-M-M, Cetorelli-J-J, Roberts-R-M
Abstract: Plasma membranes have been isolated without proteolytic modification from fibroblast lines derived from patients with CF, from heterozygous parents, and from normal children. The cells had been grown in the presence of 3H- OR 14C- labeled L-leucine, D- glucosamine, and L-fucose. Membranes were mixed in suitable combinations to allow comparisons to be made between the different cell types. No differences in the plasma membrane composition, as revealed by divergence in 3H- or 14C-profiles, could be detected after gel electrophoresis. Identical protein and glycoprotein components were present in approximately similar amounts in all groups of cells;

Title: Comparative pathology of marine invertebrates and the study of human disease
Authors: Bang-F-B
Abstract: Studies on an infection with gram-negative bacteria in Limulus led to the discovery of the extreme sensitivity of the amebocytes to a gram-negative endotoxin.  This led to the development of a method for measuring very small amounts of endotoxin in biologic fluids and in human blood.  Yet, had the original observation of Cantacuzene on the large common edible spider crab been followed, this remarkable sensitivity of marine arthropod blood to endotoxin would have been recognized much earlier.  The original work of Metchnikoff on sea star larvae stimulated him to develop the major theory of phagocytosis but, until the adult animal of the same genus was re-examined half a century later, the presence of a powerful substance which selectively inhibits growth of lymphocytes following primary immunization remained unknown.  Though mucus secretion is a fundamental characteristic of most invertebrate phyla and all vertebrates, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of the secretory process; studies of the responses of specialized invertebrate secretory cells to infection have now led to a new means of studying macromolecular control of mucus secretion in man.  These three stories emphasize the continuing need to study disease as a biologic phenomenon.

Title: Colonization by Enterobacteriaceae of the respiratory tract of children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and their antibody response
Authors: Seidmon-E-J, Mosovich-L-L, Neter-E
Abstract: Of 72 patients with fibrosis, 49 harbored Enterobacteriaceae in the respiratory tract, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Colonization by two to four genera was documented in 29 subjects. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 44 of these 49 patients. The distribution of serogroups of E. coli was similar to that seen in patients with urinary tract infection. Antibody response against the O antigens of the patients' own Enterobacteriaceae was documented in 29 of these 49 children and encountered more often in patients with severe disease. Colonization by Enterobacteriaceae in the absence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was seen more frequently in children with the mild form of the illness.

Title: Growth, intelligence, and school performance in children with cystic fibrosis who have had an episode of malnutrition during infancy
Authors: Ellis-C-E, Hill-D-E
Abstract: In this study, we have compared two groups of children with cystic fibrosis.  One group of CF children had severe malnutrition in the first year of life, whereas the second group of CF children had not been malnourished.  The catch-up growth experienced by both the control and malnourished groups was impressive and was generally complete in terms of height and weight for age.  This finding is consistent with other reports regarding catch-up growth following malnutrition associated with celiac disease, anorexia nervosa, renal acidosis, Cushing syndrome, and hypothyroidism.  Though the malnourished group tended to have lower IQ and school performance scores, the differences were not statistically significant except for backward digit span.  That difference may indicate an organic impairment due to malnutrition or to any of several other factors. Our data fail to demonstrate any permanent or devastating effect of early malnutrition during a very rapid growth phase on the subsequent growth, IQ, and school performance in children with cystic fibrosis studied at age 7 to 10 years.

Title: Absorption of digoxin in children with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Moss-A-J, Finkelstein-S, Crudup-C, Young-G-A, Dooley-R-R
Abstract: The absorption of digoxin in cystic fibrosis was evaluated in 16 subjects by assessing the relationship between dosage expressed in mug/kg/day and serum digoxin concentration. The results indicate that the same relationship exists between maintenance dosage and serum levels in these patients and in patients without cystic fibrosis. Thus, no evidence of impaired absorption was found.

Title: Significance of absent vas deferens at hernia repair in infants and children
Authors: Lukash-F, Zwiren-G-T, Andrews-H-G
Abstract: An absent vas deferens may be associated with unilateral renal agenesis or undiagnosed cystic fibrosis. Such patients should be further evaluated with a sweat chloride and intravenous pyelogram. The finding of absent vas deferens during exploration for an undescended testis does not provide absolute evidence for absence of the testis, since these structures have independent embryologic origins.

Title: Size distribution of lymphocytes in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Authors: Brungard-K, Moser-G, Athreya-B-H
Abstract: The diameters of circulating peripheral lymphocytes were measured in 28 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These were compared with lymphocyte measurements in 68 normal children, 19 children with asthma, and 12 children with cystic fibrosis. The average diameter of lymphocytes in normal children was found to be 11.2 microns. In contrast, the average diameter of lymphocytes in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was 12.7 microns (P less than 0.0001). There were more lymphocytes with a diameter of 13 to 15 microns in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis than in normal children.

Title: Cystic fibrosis in a Chinese girl
Authors: Boon-W-H
Abstract: A four year old Chinese girl of parents who emigrated to Singapore from South China was found to be suffering from bronchiectasis as a result of repeated chest infections, and failure to thrive. Investigations confirmed the bronchiectasis, and, in the course of attempting to elucidate the course, sweat Cl and sweat Na were found to be raised.  The patient occasionally passed soft bulky stools and the Vitamin A absorption test was abnormal.  The pathogenesis, problems in diagnosis and the genetics are briefly reviewed.  This is the first proved case of cystic fibrosis occurring in a child of pure Chinese stock, and the first to be described in South-East Asia. Cystic fibrosis occurring in non-Caucasians in reviewed.

Title: Letter: Detection of cystic fibrosis and heterozygotes
Authors: Schwachman-H, Araki-H, Field-M
Abstract: During the past year, we have developed a new assay for cystic fibrosis by utilising the Ussing chamber technique and measuring the electrical properties of rat jejunum in the presence of the sera to be tested.  The potential difference (P.D.) and resistance (R.) are measured with a sensitive electrometer at 5-minute intervals over 60 minutes.  We were able to detect 90% of the heterozygotes.  The possibility of detecting the remaining 10% is present, and can, we feel, be achieved by using a more concentrated specimen.

Title: Letter: Essential fatty acids and cystic fibrosis
Authors: McEvoy-F-A
Abstract: I have measured the fatty-acid profile of C.F. erythrocyte membranes in view of the fact that some variations in membrane activity have been observed with this system.  The results show that there was a lowered content of linoleate (18:2) and arachidonate (20:4) in C.F. erythrocyte membranes, and the total essential-fatty-acid content was significantly lower than either control group.  There was no significant difference in the concentrations of the other major fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, and oleate) and we could not observe any striking alteration in the concentration of any of the minor fatty-acid components of the membrane.  It would thus appear that the overall fatty-acid pattern in C.F. erythrocyte membranes is altered only by a diminution in those fatty acids which are of dietary origin.  The fact that there was considerable overlap between the C.F. and control data makes it rather unlikely that the fatty-acid profile closely reflects the biochemical lesion of the disease.  When the essential-fatty-acid levels of the C.F. samples were compared with the Schwachman clinical scores of the patients, there was a surprisingly poor correlation (r = 0.49) which was not statistically significant.  The correlation with the nutritional part of the clinical score was equally low.  Diminished essential-fatty-acid content is often observed in many acute illnesses.  In addition, the possibility exists that C.F. patients may be particularly susceptible to essential-fatty-acid depletion due to their pancreatic dysfunction.  Further research on fatty-acid transport and metabolism in C.F. is clearly needed to establish the role of essential fatty acids in the disease.

Title: Letter: Complement in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Conover-J-H, Conod-E-J
Abstract: Lieberman reported that there was considerable overlap in quantitative C3 levels between all of the C.F. subjects tested, and the control group.  His control group, however, was composed of subjects with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, in whom C.F. had been ruled out.  The use of a more proper control group by Lieberman, either in place of or in parallel with his "diseased" control groups, would have provided a more meaningful interpretation concerning the role of complement in cystic fibrosis.  We agree that there is a tendency for C3 to be higher in C.F. females than in C.F. males.  Although Lieberman was quick to dispel any notion of C3a being implicated in the aetiology of C.F., he overlooked the one facet of our initial study that still makes our hypothesis feasible - raised C3 levels in C.F. obligate heterozygotes.  Hann et al. reported that serum-C5 was raised in both C.F. patients and their parents.  Our initial data on C5 levels by radial immunodiffusion and haemolytic studies do not confirm this finding.  We are supporting the hypothesis that C.F. is either a complement-caused or complement-mediated disorder, in which a C3a-like molecule (C3a, bradykinin) either alone or by complexing with IgG gives rise to the physiological and pathological state of C.F.

Title: Letter: Screening for cystic fibrosis
Authors: Stephan-U, Brauning-C, Busch-E-W
Abstract: We read with interest Dr Raine's paper but would like to stress that Hellsing and Kollberg used a single radial immunodiffusion method not radioimmunoassay.  Prosser et al. demonstrated quite clearly that similar results were obtained in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.) screening with test-strips and with more elaborate methods of albumin detection in meconium.  Using both radial immunodiffusion as well as test-strips, Kollberg's group noticed a decreased albumin content in C.F. meconium stored at room temperature and mailed for several days.  Diminished albumin concentration might have been brought about by remaining proteolytic activity.  Prosser et al. found no change in albumin content during refrigerator storage. Approximately 10% of C.F. cases have no raised albumin content in meconium and this problem has not yet been solved.

Title: Letter: Frequency of cystic-fibrosis gene
Authors: Crawfurd-M-D
Abstract: Mr Stuart and Dr Burdon speculate on the possibility that the high frequency of the cystic-fibrosis gene among Caucasians may be due to the heterozygotes having some advantage in biological fitness over normal homozygotes.  They suggest that this might be due to increased resistance to typhus, once endemic in Europe, on the basis of the well-known immunological cross-reactivity between the causative organism, Rickettsia prowazeki, and certain strains of the species Proteus vulgaris, which is agglutinated by sera from cystic-fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.  However, there is no evidence that this agglutination is an immunological reaction.  It appears microscopically to be associated with disorganisation and inhibition of the bacterial flagellae leading to clumping of the organisms.  As such it is probably analogous to the effect on cilia of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gills.  The cilia factor, although associated with IgG, is now known not to be IgG itself and may well be the C3a component of complement.  These and other observations, such as those on salivary and sweat gland secretions and on sodium flux, suggest that all these phenomena are membrane rather than immunological effects.  Although it is possible that a Proteus flagella antigen could also be the binding site for the cilia factor, this seems improbable.  An alternative hypothesis is that heterozygotes for the cystic-fibrosis gene have increased resistance to tuberculosis.  This would meet the requirement of a common disease recently endemic in Europe at least as well as typhus, and is suggested by indirect evidence from a family study demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of tuberculosis among the parents of cystic-fibrosis patients than among parents of controls.

Title: Editorial: Pseudomonas vaccines
Authors: No authors available
Abstract: Few antibiotics have therapeutic value against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and each of them has shortcomings.  It is therefore important to try and prevent pseudomonas infection in patients with severe burns, immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, and other conditions or methods of treatment that make them particularly susceptible to invasion by these bacteria.

Title: Letter: Fatty-acid oxidation in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Emery-A-E, Farrell-K, Keay-A-J, McCrae-W-M
Abstract: The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is unknown.  We therefore undertook to study fatty-acid oxidation (Beta-oxidation) in patients with C.F.  There was no significant difference in the results obtained in controls and either affected individuals or heterozygous carriers.  All the values in the affected individuals lay within the normal range.  Unless for some special reason the defect is not expressed in leukocytes, these results indicate that the metabolic pathway involved in fatty-acid oxidation (Beta-oxidation) is intact in C.F.  It therefore seems unlikely that the reported deficiency of certain essential fatty acids in C.F. is the result of a defect in fatty-acid metabolism.

Title: Letter: C3 in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Scanlin-T-F-Jr, Norman-M-E, Rosenlund-M-L
Abstract: We believe that serum-levels of individual complement components in children cannot be meaningfully interpreted unless they are compared with normal values obtained from age-matched controls.  In a study of 163 healthy infants and children we found a statistically significant correlation of C3 levels with age, but not with sex or race, and we also found a wide range of values within any given age-group.  In contrast to previous reports, we did not find raised C3 levels in the majority of our C.F. patients when the values were compared with projected group mean values for the appropriate age, and we did not find a significant elevation of the mean C3 level for the C.F. patients in any of the age-groups tested.

Title: Letter: Heterozygote advantage in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Dodge-J-A, Burton-L
Abstract: In a recent study, we attempted to assess the personality characteristics of both mothers and fathers of children with cystic fibrosis.  In all, more than 150 such parents were interviewed. During the course of the interview, the Taylor manifest anxiety scale, Fouldes' personality inventory, and the 16 PF test form A were used.  It was apparent that these parents represented a wide range of personality types, and differed in no way from the general population.

Title: Letter: Essential-fatty-acid metabolism in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Watts-R, Taylor-S, Postuma-R, Smalley-C-A
Abstract: 6 patients with proven cystic fibrosis and a wide variety of Schwachman clinical scores were studied and the controls were 10 healthy children undergoing minor elective surgical procedures.  The results show that for children with cystic fibrosis there are not only decreased proportions of essential fatty acids but that 20:3 omega-9 is found in all cases.  Our results suggest that there is no intrinsic defect of the desaturating system in cystic fibrosis and that the pattern of essential-fatty-acid deficiency is entirely similar to that found in dietary deficiency of essential fatty acids.  A further significant finding is the occurance if 20:3 omega-9 in apparently healthy children, particularly the very young. This is probably diet-related and emphasises the young child's very large requirement for essential fatty acids for membrane synthesis. The need for adequate polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood cannot be overstated, whether they be for normal membrane synthesis or lowering of serum-lipids, giving possible protection against cardiovascular disease.

Title: Letter: Essential fatty acids in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Robinson-P-G
Abstract: In three literature reports the linoleic acid (L.A.) levels for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) compared to controls are always more significantly lower than arachidonic acid (A.A.).  Similarly the percentage lowering is also more for L.A. than A.A.  There is, thus, no "overwhelming" evidence for a blocked or absent desaturase and the cause of the E.F.A. deficiency must be elsewhere.  We have found up to 2.5% of the total fatty acids in both serum and red cells to be C20:3-omega-9.  All of our C.F. patients have shown this acid at some stage and, for most, it is a permanent feature of their fatty acid profile.  It has been reported that C20:3-omega-9 would probably act as an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from A.A. and it is interesting to conjecture on whether this could account for some of the symptoms of C.F.  C20:3-omega-9 would also be incorporated into P.I. and could then alter membrane properties.

Title: Letter: Essential-fatty-acid metabolism in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Press-M
Abstract: In an investigation of the effects of intestinal malabsorption on plasma-lipids, we compared the fatty-acid composition of the serum-lecithin of 23 patients with malabsorption from a variety of different causes and found similar changes irrespective of the underlying cause of the malabsorption.  The only exception to this was that classical E.F.A. deficiency was found only in patients whose malabsorption was due to massive small-bowel resection.  All other causes of malabsorption gave rise to changes identical to those found by other workers in C.F.; there is thus no reason to postulate an additional metabolic abnormality specific to C.F.  The relatively normal amounts of arachidonic acid reported in some E.F.A. deficient patients may not be entirely due to arachidonic acid.

Title: Letter: Cystic fibrosis: detection of heterozygotes
Authors: Barnes-G-L, Ekert-H, Dowling-S-V
Abstract: Samuels and Elliott have described a new technique for detecting cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and the heterozygote for C.F.  We have tested this technique in detail on a smaller number of patients.  Although the number of samples tested in our study is small, results suggest that this technique is not likely to be successful in detection of heterozygotes for C.F.

Title: Letter: Defective essential-fatty-acid metabolism in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Thompson-G
Abstract: Mr Rivers and Mr Hassam propose that the subnormal levels of linoleic acid (18:2) found in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis are due to malabsorption.  To substantiate their hypothesis they deduce that the remarkable remission observed in a cystic-fibrosis patient given intravenous 'Intralipid' was due not to the 18:2 content of the 20% triglyceride component of the fat emulsion but to the 20:4 content of its 1.2% phospholipid component (not 6% as they state).  This explanation seems unlikely in view of the relatively small proportion of 20:4 in intralipid phospholipid, especially since intravenous administration of intralipid phospholipid to healthy subjects decreases both the 18:2 and 20:4 content of their plasma-phospholipids.  Comparison of the effects of complete intralipid versus intralipid phospholipid on the level of 20:4 in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis would soon determine whether they lack the ability to desaturate 18:2 to 20:4.

Title: Pancreatic supplementation for premature babies [letter]
Authors: Robinson-P-G, Elliott-R-B
Abstract: For some time now we have been using a screening test for cystic fibrosis based on levels of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin on the fourth day of life.  One interesting observation is the number of premature babies who have little or no pancreatic trypsin or chymotrypsin at this time.  For example, of the babies tested from St. Helen's Maternity Hospital between June, 1974, and April, 1975, 84 were classified as premature in the birth-records book.  Samples were received for only 65 of these babies.  Of these 65 babies, 26 (40%) had stool-trypsin levels of <100 microg. per g. compared with only 2.5% of the other babies tested during this period.  As may be expected, the lower-birth-weight babies tend to have lower stool-enzyme concentrations.  We feel that our data indicate that at least some premature babies would benefit from pancreatic-enzyme supplementation or predigested foods in the first few days after birth.

Title: Defective essential-fatty-acid metabolism in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Rivers-J-P, Hassam-A-G
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is characterised by low serum levels of essential fatty acids (E.F.A.). However, the fatty-acid pattern does not totally resemble that of dietary E.F.A. deficiency. The differences suggest a reduction in the desaturation of E.F.S. It is not known whether this defect is the primary lesion in C.F. or is the result of tissue damage in the disease. It is proposed that C.F. patients might have increased linoleic-acid requirements, and possibly specific requirements for its desaturation products.

Title: Letter: Cystic fibrosis: detection of heterozygotes
Authors: Samuels-C-E, Elliott-R-B
Abstract: We have developed a new technique for detecting cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and the heterozygote of C.F.  The assay can be done by any laboratory having an aggregometer for measuring platelet aggregation. Quantitation of the results is obtained by comparing the transmittance recorded when only A.D.P. is added to platelet-rich plasma (P.R.P.). In C.F. patients and known heterozygotes, this ratio is 4 - 9 times higher than in healthy subjects.  We have tested P.R.P. from 40 healthy people, 25 patients with C.F., and 40 known heterozygotes.  We could detect all C.F. patients and 95% of the known heterozygotes.

Title: Skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Johns-M-K
Abstract: It had been noticed that in cases of cystic fibrosis the palmar skin of the fingers and the plantar skin of the toes wrinkled very quickly when immersed in water.  Almost without exception, the children with cystic fibrosis had noticeable wrinkling of the fingers within 2 min of immersion in hand-hot water, whereas normal children showed no (or minimal) wrinkling after 10 min.  This wrinkling is due to an excess of salt in the skin, which increases water-binding capacity of keratin.  The test would thus appear to provide a simple and cheap screening method for cystic fibrosis, but one that may not be absolutely reliable.

Title: Adverse effects of iodides on thyroid function
Authors: Vagenakis-A-G, Braverman-L-E
Abstract: The administration of pharmacologic quantities of iodine such as iodides for the treatment of pulmonary disease, organic iodine present in medications and x-ray contrast dyes, and the ingestion of iodine-rich natural foods, may result in goiter, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism, especially in patients with underlying thyroid disease. Medications containing iodide may induce hypothroidism in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 131I or surgically treated Graves' disease, or following hemithyroidectomy for nodules; and they may induce hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic iodine- deficient goiter, autonomous nodules or nontoxic nodular goiter, or in patients recently treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease. Rarely, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may develop in patients with completely normal thyroid function during administration of iodide. The etiology of iodide-induced goiter and hypothyroidism in patients with cystic fibrosis remains obscure. Iodide-induced myxedema may also occur in patients receiving drugs which alter thyroid function, such as lithium, phenazone, and sulfisoxazole. Finally, iodides do have a role in the treatment of hyperthyroidism but their use should probably be restricted to thyroid storm, preoperative preparation of the hyperthyroid patient, and following 131I treatment.

Title: Vitamin E
Authors: No authors available
Abstract: Vitamin E has been claimed to prevent, ameliorate, or cure skin disease, warts, ulcers, strabismus, baldness, frostbite, arthritis, jaundice, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, liver dysfunction, thyroid disease, sexual impotence, and aging.  The vitamin has recently been added to cosmetics, used as a deodorant, and alleged to be an effective antidote to air pollution.  There is no evidence that large doses of vitamin E are effective for the prevention or treatment of heart disease or any other human disorder, except in premature infants and possibly in patients with diseases that impair fat absorption.  Adverse effects, though rare, have resulted from ingestion of large doses of vitamin E.

Title: The challenges of cystic fibrosis
Authors: Woodruff-C, Barbero-G-J
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a generalized disorder of the exocrine glands inherited as a recessive genetic trait.  The disease was more fully described as a specific entity in 1939 with a pathology of dilated ducts and fibrotic changes in the pancreas and copious secretory intraluminal obstruction of the bronchial tree.  The symptoms predominately involve the gastrointestinal tract as more frequent, bulky, malformed and malodorous stools and the respiratory system as cough, wheezing and signs of chronic respiratory obstruction.  In certain instances, only one of these two systems will have manifest symptoms and signs.  An increased concentration of sodium and chloride in the sweat was discovered in 1953.  The elevated salt concentration of the sweat has proven to be a reliable diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of the disease.  Few diseases present in so many different forms, degrees of severity and at different ages as does CF.  All present treatments for cystic fibrosis are essentially symptomatic.  Since the study of families having a child with cystic fibrosis has shown an incidence of the disease in one fourth of their siblings, classification of the disease as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder suggests that the concept of an abnormal gene related to alteration in a single enzyme should apply.  The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in childhood is an overwhelming even to the patient and his family.

Title: Recurrent diarrhoea in children
Authors: Kuzemko-J-A
Abstract: Diarrhoea can be defined as the passage of loose stools and increased bowel frequency above the accepted norm for the individual and resulting in excess loss of water and electrolytes in the faeces.  It may or may not be associated with steatorrhea (fatty stools). History plays a vital part in the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal disease in children.  Time spent here is often more rewarding than a battery of specialised investigations.  One must be clear what the parent means by diarrhoea, as terminology among doctors, nurses, and parents is often confusing.  When dealing with children one must always adopt a comprehensive approach and consider the whole child and his family.  Common causes, mechanisms, and consequences are discussed.  Some of the common causes of diarrhoea are cystic fibrosis, gluten-induced enteropathy (coeliac disease), Giardia lamblia, sugar intolerance, gastro-intestinal allergy, and irritable bowel syndrome.

Title: Nursing care study: Sally--a child with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Noakes-S
Abstract: Fibrocystic disease is a common disease of childhood and the pancreas is abnormal in 90% of these cases.  There is fibrosis with atrophy of the exocrine parenchymal tissue, but islet cell tissue is rarely involved.  Mucous glands throughout the body are grossly distended and they secrete an abnormal viscid mucus.  Sweat glands appear normal, but they secrete sweat with an abnormally high concentration of electrolytes.  A characteristic feature of the disease is the widespread chronic bronchiolitis.  This is due to the Staphylococcus aureus which grow best in a salt-rich medium.

Title: The pathology of infertility
Authors: Craig-J-M
Abstract: In most series of infertility patients, approximately 40 to 60 percent have no discernible cause for infertility.  No wonder that those working with this condition tend to seize upon any demonstrable tissue abnormality as related to the infertility.  The use of fallible diagnostic tools may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.  In studies of the accuracy of dye injections to demonstrate tubal patency by roentgenogram the large errors introduced by these methods were emphasized.  Between 30 to 40 percent of tubes found blocked by using a single dye examination and using the criterion of "filling but not spilling" into the peritoneal cavity, or with apparent obstruction at the uterotubal junction, were subsequently found to be patent.  Similar data were offered by others.  Lesions with less obvious and demonstrable causal relationship to infertility, such as pelvic adhesions and endometriosis, are more difficult to judge as to their etiologic relation.  These are assessed in discussions of male and female infertility.

Title: Gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis
Authors: Shwachman-H
Abstract: From a historical view cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered a disease of the pancreas which results in maldigestion and loss of fat, and nitrogen in the stool.  A number of early synonyms included congenital steatorrhea, pancreatic infantilism, and pancreatic fibrosis.  The concern of the pediatrician in the late 1930's and early 1940's was to distinguish nonfatal celiac disease from fatal cystic fibrosis.  In 1954, Shwachman presented clinical and laboratory features that distinguish these two entities.  Today one is not justified in making a diagnosis of celiac disease without a confirmatory small intestinal biopsy coupled with a normal sweat test.  A number of gastrointestinal complications in cystic fibrosis are examined: meconium ileus, intestinal obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, lactase deficiency, intestinal impaction, intussusception, rectal prolapse, growth retardation, excessive appetite, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, gallbladder problems, and diabetes.  The article closes by recording the indications for the sweat test.

Title: A new assay for cystic fibrosis factor: effects of sera from patients with cystic fibrosis in the in vitro electrical properties of rat jejunum
Authors: Araki-H, Field-M, Shwachman-H
Abstract: The in vitro electrical properties of rat jejunum were utilized to assay a factor or factors in serum from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Sera from patients with CF were found to decrease short circuit current (SCC) and the SCC response to glucose, and to increase electrical resistance. These effects were present in all 24 patients with CF and 10 of 14 parents of CF patients and absent from the serum of 21 control subjects. This quantitative technique provides an alternative to the ciliostatic assays for the detection of the CF factor or factors.

Title: Inhibition of ouabain-sensitive ATPase by the saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas
Authors: Cole-C-H, Sella-G
Abstract: A study has been made of the effect of saliva from children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CFP) on various components of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme system. The ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity of erythrocyte membranes prepared from intact erythrocytes preincubated with CFP saliva was 35 +/- 4 nmol Pi/mg fry wt membrane suspension/hr, compared with 48 +/- 7 nmol Pi/mg dry wt membrane suspension/hr when the erythrocytes were preincubated with control saliva. A calcium-activated component of ATPase was decreased from 202 +/- 30 nmol Pi/mg dry wt membrane suspension/hr in erythrocytes preincubated with control saliva, to 151 +/- 17 nmol Pi/mg dry wt membrane suspension/hr when the incubation was carried out with CFP saliva. In a second series of experiments, ultrafiltered saliva was added directly to an ATPase assay. The saliva from children with CFP brought about a mean decrease in ouabain-sensitive ATPase of 16% compared with control saliva.

Title: Studies on cystic fibrosis using isoelectric focusing.  I. An assay for detection of cystic fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygote carriers from serum
Authors: Wilson-G-B, Fudenberg-H-H
Abstract: We have developed a standardized biophysical assay for the rapid detection of individuals homozygous or heterozygous for cystic fibrosis (C/F). The assay employs isoelectric focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels to analyze microliter quantities of whole serum for the presence of a C/F factor protein and for deletions in a group of proteins called proteins B, C, and D (Fig, 1). A pH 5-10 gradient is used (Fig. 2) and each sample is screened using a serum volume which contains 300 g immunoglobulin G (IgG). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for C/F are distinguished from normal unaffected individuals on the basis of the presence of a C/F factor protein band (Table 1). Heterozygous carriers for C/F are distinguished from C/F homozygotes 75 percent of the time, on the basis of a deletion in either band B, C, or D (Table 2). On the basis of screening 65 patients with cystic fibrosis, 61 heterozygous carriers for C/F, and 105 normal control subjects, it was concluded that no obvious correlation existed between either sex, age, or severity of the disease in the individual C/F patient, and the absolute presence or absence of the C/F factor. In addition, no correlation existed between sex or age and the presence of the C/F factor or deletions in proteins B, C, and D in the individual heterozygous carrier for C/F or normal control subjects. Analysis of serum samples from 68 patients with a variety of other diseases, many with clinical symptoms resembling those seen in the patient with cystic fibrosis (Table 3), indicated that the C/F factor protein described in this study appears to be diagnostic for C/F genotypes, with the possible exception of patients with certain types of leukemia.

Title: Deficiency of arginine esterase in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas: demonstration of the proteolytic nature of the activity
Authors: Rao-G-J, Nadler-H-L
Abstract: Proteolytic activity, defined as the hydrolysis of peptide bonds involving the carboxyl group of L-arginine, in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis, heterozygotes, and control subjects has been assayed using a fluorometric method with protamine as the substrate and fluorescamine as the reagent. The mean total proteolytic activity in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-half the mean total activity in control subjects and heterozygotes. The mean proteolytic activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-third that of control subjects and heterozygotes. The relationship of arginine esterase activity to proteolytic activity was investigated. The pH optimum and action of reversible and irreversible inhibitors were similar for both activities, suggesting that the arginine esterase activity and proteolytic activity represent similar catalytic entities. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis may reside in the deficiency of a proteolytic enzyme which results in the accumulation of the various cationic macromolecular "factors" described by other investigators in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The demonstration of a deficiency of proteolytic activity as assayed by the hydrolysis of protamine, a cationic polypeptide, could explain the presence of ciliotoxic cationic protein or polypeptide factors in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis and may, in some unknown manner, be related to the clinical manifestations of the disease.

Title: Demonstration of human leukocyte degranulation induced by sera from homozygotes and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis
Authors: Conod-E-J, Conover-J-H, Hirschhorn-K
Abstract: The ability of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA)-treated normal serum and of cystic fibrosis (CF)-affected and carrier sera to promote the release of lysosomal enzymes from sensitized human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was assessed through the measurement of beta- glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activity after exposure of these cells to the various test sera. This study was initiated to extend the analogies between preciliary dyskinesia factor (pre-CDF), separated from the cell-free media of cultures derived from CF homozygous and heterozygous individuals, and C3a anaphylatoxin. The extent of lysosomal degranulation of human PMN exposed to fresh untreated sera of each of five controls, seven CF homozygotes, and eight heterozygotes, as expressed by the amount of beta-glucuronidase releases, was 7.84% (+/- 0.934) for control sera, 14.01% (+/- 1.79) for CF-affected sera, and 10.61% (+/- 1.43) for heterozygous sera. The difference between CF homozygotes and control subjects is significant (P less than 0.0001), as is the difference between CF- affected and carrier individuals (0.001 less than P less than 0.005) and between control subjects and carriers (0.001 less than P less than 0.005), when beta-glucuronidase. However, the differences between control subjects and CF heterozygous individuals are not significant. Treatment of these sera with 1 M EACA gave values for beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase release which are slightly reduced when compared with those obtained with fresh, untreated samples. EACA apparently reduces the activity of beta-glucuronidase released from PMN. Amicon filtration studies of these serum samples demonstrated that degranulating ability and the presence of cilicary dyskinesia, as assessed by rabbit tracheal bioassay, are not always associated. Therefore, the relationship between pre-CDF and the degranulator activity in native CF-affected and carrier sera is unclear, in part because of the limitations inherent in the test systems employed.

Title: Serum glutathione reductase and cystic fibrosis
Authors: Shapiro-B-L, Smith-Q-T, Warick-W-J
Abstract: Serum glutathione reductase (NADPH-GSSG oxidoreductase, EC. 1.6.4.2 (GR)) has been examined in cystic fibrosis subjects (CF), obligate CF heterozygotes, and control subjects. Serum protein concentration was similar in the three groups. Regardless of the units used to express activity (milligrams of protein or milliliters of serum) or whether or not samples were dialyzed against water or phosphate buffer, mean serum GR in CF was greater than in control subjects (P less than or equal to 0.002) in all series over several years. Under the above assay conditions no difference in serum GR between control subjects and carriers was detected. Calculated and assayed values of combined control and CF sera agreed as did expected and observed 50% activity in 1:2 sera dilutions in CF, control subjects, and carriers. Addition of FAD to incubation media did not effect enzyme activity in the three groups. Differences between CF and control subjects persisted after dialysis in membranes permitting passage of molecules of approximately 12,000 mol wt or less. These findings would tend to exclude the effect of extraneous serum factors in explaining the differences between CF and control subjects. The percentage of initial GR activity after four days storage (0-4 degrees) was significantly greater in CF than in control subjects (P less than 0.025). The effect of heparin on serum GR was recorded as the percentage of activity after incubation with heparin vs. activity in the standard assay for individual subjects. The effect of incubation with 5 mug/ml heparin on serum GR activity was greater in control subjects than in carriers (P less than 0.0005) and CF (P less than 0.0005). Mean serum GR activity in CF and carriers was unaffected by heparin, whereas mean activity in control subjects was decreased. In no control was the percentage of initial activity with heparin greater than the mean of CF and carrier groups. Only 3 of 20 CF and 4 of 20 carrier individuals had percentages lower than the control mean. The CF and carrier distributions were clearly different from the control distribution. Serum GR was determined in seven non-CF individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Activity in the COPD was different from CF and no different from control subjects. In none of these controls or COPD was serum GR as great as the CF mean. Serum GR in no CF was as low as the mean of control subjects or COPD. It is concluded that serum GR activity is greater in CF than in control subjects, carriers, and non-CF COPD subjects; that the difference in activity is not attributable to an extraneous serum factor, that the activity difference is not secondary to chronic respiratory disease; that in comparison with control subjects, GR from CF serum behaves differently after storage; and that serum GR from CF and carriers behaves differently from control GR in the presence of heparin.

Title: Do brine shrimp diagnose cystic fibrosis?
Authors: Hodes-M-E, Thomas-J, Morgan-S, Merritt-A-D
Abstract: The nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina are dependent upon the function of their salt gland to maintain osmotic pressure within narrow limits. A number of drugs interfere with this function and are lethal to the nauplii. Saliva and serum from normal persons, patients with cystic fibrosis, and obligate heterozygotes were tested for lethal effect against brine shrimp nauplii. At salt concentrations between 100 mM and 2.5 no difference was found among the phenotypes. At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product. No difference was noted in the O2 uptake of nauplii treated with saliva or serum obtained from normal subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis, or obligate heterozygotes.

Title: The chronically reserpinized rat as a possible model for cystic fibrosis.  I. Submaxillary gland morphology and ultrastructure
Authors: Martinez-J-R, Adelstein-E, Quissel-D, Barbero-G-J
Abstract: Rats treated for 7 days with reserpine develop structural changes in the submaxillary gland that resemble those that have been reported in cystic fibrosis. The salivary exocrinopathy is characterized by increased amounts of PAS-reactive mucoprotein in the acinar cells and by obstruction and dilatation of ducts by precipitated material with the same staining characteristics as those found in the acinar elements.

Title: Arylsulfatase B deficiency in Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome: Cellular studies and carrier identification
Authors: Beratis-N-G, Turner-B-M, Weiss-R, Hirschhorn-K
Abstract: Arylsulfatase B deficiency was demonstrated in peripheral leukocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts, and a lymphoid line derived from a patient with MLS. The patient's parents demonstrated levels of arylsulfatase B that were intermediate between those found in patient and those in control subjects. The activity (mean plus or minus SD) in leukocytes from normal subjects, the patient's parents, and the patient was 113.7 plus or minus 36.2, 31.0, and 5.2 nmol 4-nitrocatechol/mg protein/hr, respectively. In skin fibroblasts of the same subjects the activity was 145.2 plus or minus 41.6, 58.5, and 7.0, respectively. Nine other lysosomal enzymes were normal in skin fibroblasts of the patient. No arylsulfatase B activity was detected in a lymphoid line established from the patient with MLS. The arylsulfatase B activity in cultured amniotic fluid cells from 10 normal pregnancies was 203.2 plus or minus 49.9.

Title: The chronically reserpinized rat as a possible model for cystic fibrosis.  II.  Comparison and cilioinhibitory effects of submaxillary saliva
Authors: Martinez-J-R, Adshead-P-C, Quissell-D-O, Barbero-G-J
Abstract: Submaxillary saliva from reserpine-treated rats was found to have alterations in composition similar to those reported in the same secretion from patients with cystic fibrosis. Changes included elevated concentrations of Na+, Ca++, protein, and carbohydrate. In addition, this saliva was found to have ciliotoxic properties similar to those of CF serum. The similarities in cilioinhibitory effects salivary composition, and histologic appearance justify the use of the chronically reserpinized rat as a model for cystic fibrosis.

Title: Complex saccharide metabolism in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts
Authors: Welch-D-W, Roberts-R-M
Abstract: There are several reports of secretory and other abnormalities present in cultured fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have, therefore, investigated aspects of complex saccharide synthesis and secretion by such cells compared with fibroblasts derived from heterozygous (HZ) parents and from normal (N) children. The main glycosaminoglycans produced by skin fibroblasts  during in vitro culture were hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfates, and dermatan sulfate-like materials. Using double-label experiments with D-[3H]- or [14c]glucosamine and analyzing the products by ion exchange chromatography, it was shown for five CF, two HZ, and four N lines that these polysaccharides were secreted into the medium in approximately similar proportions to each other. Moreover, experiments in which three CF, nine HZ, and three N lines were grown in log phase for up to 5 days in the presence of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine indicate that, during such a period, CF fibroblasts do not secrete complex carbohydrates at rates significantly different from N or HZ cells. Neither do such cells shown an abnormal intracellular accumulation of complex carbohydrates. The latter observation was further confirmed by preparing whole cell autoradiographs during growth of six CF, two HZ, and three N lines in the presence of D-[3H]glucosamine and, subsequently, after addition of unlabeled medium.

Title: Polyamines in cystic fibrosis
Authors: McEvoy-F-A, Hartley-C-B
Abstract: Polyamine concentrations have been measured in blood samples from a series of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and control subjects. Analyses were made by a fluorometric method, in which the amines were reacted with dansyl chloride and separated by thin layer chromatography on Kieselguhr. There was no significant difference between the polyamine concentrations of blood samples from CF patients and control subjects. Also, the spermidine-spermine ratio was similar in both groups. Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine concentrations in neoplastic states. Since measurable amounts of spermine and spermidine were detected in all six bile preparations available for this study, analysis of these substances in bile may be of benefit in particular cases.

Title: Recurrent acute pancreatitis in patients with cystic fibrosis with normal pancreatic enzymes
Authors: Shwachman-H, Lebenthal-E, Khaw-K-T
Abstract: Ten adolescent and young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) have had well-documented recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of CF in each patient was delayed because they did not have pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnosis of CF was documented by the typical pulmonary involvement and elevated sweat sodium and chloride levels in all cases and a positive family history in six of the ten patients. Two patients were diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis before the diagnosis of CF was made, thus indicating that acute pancreatitis may be the presenting complaint in the young adult with CF. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on the presence of severe abdominal pain, usually with vomiting, tenderness in the mid- epigastrium, elevated serum and urinary amylase and serum lipase. Attacks were precipitated by fatty meals, alcohol ingestion; postcholecystectomy and tetracycline administration. In some patients no precipitating event could be elicited. Intravenous secretin- pancreozymin stimulation tests revealed a diminished bicarbonate secretion with little effect on the secretion of the zymogen enzymes. A mild attack of pancreatitis occurred after secretin-pancreozymin stimulation. The endocrine pancreatic function tested in four patients was normal as revealed by the glucose tolerance tests and determinations of serum insulin, growth hormone and free fatty acid. Transduodenal pancreatograms were performed in three patients; one showed a normal pancreatic duct, one showed duct obstruction and in the third patient a beady type of narrowing was found. The selenomethionine Se 75 uptake of the pancreas was noted only in the head of the pancreas. This suggests that loss of function occurs initially to a greater extent in the tail and body of the pancreas. Three patients died and showed characteristic lesions of CF.

Title: Letter: Comment on outpatient intravenous therapy
Authors: David-S
Abstract: There has been a recent trend to treating more and more pediatric patients with chronic diseases on an ambulatory basis.  This is true of both hemophilia and cystic fibrosis.  Despite their success in keeping slightly more than two thirds of their patients out of the hospital, I think that they might be more successful in the future if the following points are considered.  First, many of those initially selected for intravenous medications due to their nonresponsiveness to oral therapy and again later considered failures of intravenous treatment might actually be noncompliers.  My second point concerns the lack of follow-up within the patient's home.  It would seem to me that this would be an ideal place for a public health nurse to check on the patient's condition, ensure that the procedure was being properly followed under actual field conditions, and that the correct amount of medicine has been utilized. - Dr. David's letter regarding potential problems of noncompliance and home follow-up in the use of outpatient intravenous antibiotics points out the need for this type of therapy to be instituted only in those centers in which these facets can be well controlled. Public health nurses are utilized by some centers to supervise and assist in the home management of cystic fibrosis with good success.

Title: Studies on cor pulmonale in cystic fibrosis: I. Effects of diuresis
Authors: Whitman-V, Stern-R-C, Bellet-P, Doershuk-C-F, Liebman-J
Abstract: The effects of acute diuresis in patients with cor pulmonale secondary to cystic fibrosis were studied. Both hemodynamic parameters and arterial blood gas changes were investigated. The major effect noted was a significant reduction of systemic venous pressure. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressure either remained constant or declined slightly. No consistent changes were noted in cardiac output or arterial blood gases. Acute diuresis of moderate degree appears to be a safe and effective manner in which to treat the systemic venous congestion of cor pulmonale in this situation.

Title: Endogenous and exogenous insulin responses in patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Wilmshurst-E-G, Soeldner-J-S, Holsclaw-D-S, Kaufmann-R-L
Abstract: Eight male patients with cystic fibrosis, normal nutrition, normal physical activity, relatively mild pulmonary disease, no evidence of liver disease and no family history of diabetes mellitus underwent a series of carbohydrate tolerance tests in comparison with a group of 18 normal male subjects matched for age and body weight. Compared with the normal group, the patients with cystic fibrosis had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and significantly lower serum immunoreactive insulin levels during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests; serum insulin levels were also significantly lower after intravenous administration of tolbutamide in the patients with cystic fibrosis, but the reduction in blood glucose concentration in each group was not significantly different. During an intravenous insulin test, the decrease in blood glucose concentration was the same for both groups, in spite of significantly lower serum insulin levels in the patients with cystic fibrosis .The percentage fall in plasma free fatty acids was at least as great in the patients with cystic fibrosis as in normals during the test procedures; while a significant decrease in plasma alpha-amino nitrogen after intravenously administered insulin was seen only in the patients with cystic fibrosis. These studies suggest that the carbohydrate intolerance of cystic fibrosis is consequent upon an impaired insulin response to glucose, but that this insulin deficiency is partly compensated for by increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin.

Title: Cystic fibrosis detection by means of a test-strip
Authors: Stephan-U, Busch-E-W, Kollberg-H, Hellsing-K
Abstract: The effectiveness of meconium screening for albumin as an indication of cystic fibrosis is examined. BM-Test Meconium was applied to 69,000 investigations. In 60 positive tests, cystic fibrosis was confirmed later. No increased albumin content was observed in four cases of cystic fibrosis.

Title: Studies in meconium: disaccharidase activities in meconium from cystic fibrosis patients and controls
Authors: Antonowicz-I, Ishida-S, Shwachman-H
Abstract: Meconium ileus represents the earliest clinical manifestation of cystic fibrosis. The differences found in the composition and amount of protein, mucoprotein, mucopolysaccharides, and reducing sugars in meconium from newborns with cystic fibrosis might be of significance relative to the pathogenesis and early diagnosis of this disease. We studied the enzymatic activity of disaccharidases (lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase) in meconium of infants with cystic fibrosis and controls. We found an increase in the specific activity of these enzymes in the meconium from infants with cystic fibrosis as compared to the specific activity in meconium from normal infants. The increase in the activities, expressed as micromols per gram of protein per minute was: lactase, 100 times higher; sucrase, 18 times; maltase, 4.8 times, and palatinase, 8.9 times.

Title: Enhanced renal excretion of dicloxacillin in patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Jusko-W-J, Mosovich-L-L, Gerbracht-L-M, Mattar-M-E, Yaffe-S-J
Abstract: Single oral doses of 6.25 mg/kg of dicloxacillin suspension were given to ten cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and eight normal subjects. Peak serum concentrations and areas under the concentration versus time curves for dicloxacillin were variable and, on average, were 2 1/2 times lower in the CF patients. The time of occurrence of the peak serum concentration was similar in both groups and the total urinary recovery of dicloxacillin was normal or increased in the CF patients, suggesting that the intestinal absorption of the drug was unaffected by the disease. The low serum concentrations in the CF patients were caused by unusually high renal clearances of dicloxacillin which average 282 +/- 135 compared to 95 +/- 28 ml/min/1.73 sq m in the normal subjects. Creatinine clearances were also elevated in the CF patients by 55% on average, while urea clearances were normal. The serum protein binding of dicloxacillin was similar in both groups of subjects. Because the rapid excretion results in low and variable serum concentrations of the antibiotic, treatment of CF patients with dicloxacillin may warrant use of increased or more frequent doses and monitoring of serum antibiotic levels.

Title: Cystic fibrosis: comparison of two mucolytic drugs for inhalation treatment (acetylcysteine and arginine hydrochloride)
Authors: Dietzsch-H-J, Gottschalk-B, Heyne-K, Leupoid-W, Wunderlich-P
Abstract: Clinical, bronchoscopic, spirographic, scintigraphic, and chemical analyses were done in 24 children with cystic fibrosis to assess the mucolytic effects of acetylcysteine inhalations versus L-arginine hydrochloride aerosols. The latter drug is less active than acetylcysteine and should not be used to treat children with cystic fibrosis.

Title: Pathology of cystic fibrosis review of the literature and comparison with 146 autopsied cases
Authors: Oppenheimer-E-H, Esterly-J-R
Abstract: This review of pathologic findings in cystic fibrosis includes a survey of morphologic changes from the original descriptions of CF and the numerous subsequent reports, and an analysis of 146 cases autopsied at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Billings Hospital. Achylia occurs in 85 to 90% of patients.  Approximately 1 of 7 patients with CF presents with meconium ileus.  In 1962 we described gallbladder abnormalities in 24 of 72 cases of CF (33%).  In Anderson's original description of CF, hemosiderosis was present in nearly every liver, and fatty infiltration was a frequent finding. The respiratory tract is invariably involved in CF.  The heart has never been considered a primary target organ in CF.  Bodian described a higher incidence of nephrocalcinosis in CF than in routine pediatric autopsies (31% compared to 11%).  With the increased longevity of patients with CF male sterility has become a recognized complication.  Increased electrolyte concentrations in sweat are the most diagnostic manifestation of CF, although an occasional patient has escaped this defect.  Nasal polyps are frequent and often recurrent problems in patients with CF.  Malabsorption due to pancreatic exocrine deficiency was originally described as the main manifestation of CF.  The autopsy diagnosis of CF is usually based on a combination of lesions rather than on the changes in a single organ.

Title: Evaluation of bronchial drainage in patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Tecklin-J-S, Holsclaw-D-S
Abstract: Examined in this study are the results of six tests of pulmonary function immediately preceding and following bronchial drainage in twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis. Highly significant increases averaging 5.67, 4.13, 13.47, and 6.98 percent occurred in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and inspiratory capacity respectively. Significant increases in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, and inspiratory capacity were observed in a subgroup of six of the above patients who had evidence of bronchospasm. The authors conclude that bronchial drainage will produce significant increases in routine pulmonary function values. The results suggest that this treatment is most effective in clearing the larger, more proximal, airways and is of benefit even in the presence of clinical bronchospasm.

Title: Olfactory and taste sensitivity in children with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Hertz-J, Cain-W-S, Bartoshuk-L-M, Dolan-T-F-Jr
Abstract: Psychophysical experiments measured both olfactory sensitivity to 1- butanol and sodium chloride and taste sensitivity to sodium chloride in normal children and in children with cystic fibrosis. The sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis fell within the normal range. These results stand in contrast to those of Henkin and Powell, who found children with cystic fibrosis to be hypersensitive to both olfactory and taste stimuli. Apparent hypersensitivity to taste stimuli could have resulted from the adapting effects of the relatively high level of sodium in the saliva of children with cystic fibrosis. If the contaminating effects of saliva are removed, children with cystic fibrosis yield, on the average, a taste threshold identical to that of normal children. There appears to be no simple explanation for why Henkin and Powell found hypersensitivity to odorants. The present results indicate that, in fact, children with cystic fibrosis display a slight hyposensitivity to odorants.

Title: The quest for the basic defect in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Holzel-A
Abstract: The search for the basic defect in cystic fibrosis has so far been singularly disappointing.  There is no doubt that it is a disease recessively inherited, ie that the parents carry the cystic fibrosis gene without showing any signs of ill health (heterozygous) but when transmitted from both of them to an offspring this child manifests the disease, having acquired the abnormal gene in double dose (homozygote).  Cystic fibrosis is the most common of the genetically determined diseases.  Two types of cultured cells, fibroblasts and white cells from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers for cystic fibrosis, showed characteristic changes of metachromasia that seemed to allow for a classification of patients and carriers to be distributed into separate classes.  Serum from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas disorganises the movement of cilia of the isolated rabbit tracheal mucosa.  One of the early and also most constant observations is the 'viscosity' of secretions of the mucosal glands in the respiratory tract, in the alimentary apparatus, in the biliary system and in the pancreas.  A striking increase in the levels of sodium and chloride, and to a lesser extent of potassium, is present in the sweat of practically all sufferers of cystic fibrosis.  However frustrating and tantalising the outcome of research into the basic defect has been so far, the ultimate answer is likely to be astonishing in it simplicity.

Title: Inhalation therapy in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Mearns-M-B
Abstract: Inhalation therapy can be divided into two types, intermittent aerosol therapy which is used to administer medications over brief periods and mist tent therapy which is used for prolonged periods of treatment.  The present state of knowledge of the basic defect of cystic fibrosis makes it impossible to give hard and fast guide lines for the use of inhalation therapy.  Much depends on the individual experience of the physician and the degree of pulmonary involvement of the individual patient.  Response to bronchodilators can be assessed relatively easily, assessment of mucolytics and antibiotics is difficult.  Antibiotics can be useful in helping to clear infection in those patients with early disease, as judged by clearing of pathogens from the cough swab or sputum.  In patients with chronic cough and large volumes if purulent sputum with positive culture from gram negative bacteria, the cultures never become negative and only in the occasional patient can definite clinical benefit be claimed. A few severely ill patients have dramatically improved when this therapy has been introduced, and the patients are convinced of the benefit of this treatment.  It is of course impossible in this disease, with such a varying clinical course, to prove scientifically that the inhalation therapy was the reason for this improvement.

Title: Physiotherapy for adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Gaskell-D
Abstract: Physiotherapy for adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis is continued along the same lines as for younger patients, but certain modifications may be necessary to fit in with their changing needs. When patients are transferred from the care of the paediatrician to the thoracic physician it may be helpful for them to be admitted to hospital for reassessment.  During this admission, the opportunity can be taken to review the daily physiotherapy regimen with the patients and their parents.  Postural drainage, the use of aerosols, breathing exercises, long-term follow-up, complications (haemoptysis and spontaneous pneumothorax), the use of intermittent positive pressure breathing, and terminal care are discussed.

Title: Genetics and incidence of cystic fibrosis
Authors: Carter-C-O
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis is a genetically determined disorder.  The evidence that cystic fibrosis is inherited in this way comes from several sources.  The birth frequency of cystic fibrosis is unexpectedly high in Britain for such a serious illness.  It is easy to calculate the proportion of the population who are carriers from the birth frequency of the disease.  The explanation of the unlikely high birth frequency of cystic fibrosis in Europe is not known.  An attempt to reduce substantially the birth frequency of cystic fibrosis will become possible once it is practicable to detect reliably the carrier of the gene.

Title: Physiotherapy for children with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Hodge-G-J
Abstract: The importance of regular efficient postural drainage cannot be emphasised too strongly.  Most parents of pre-school and primary school children are young enough to be physically able to play a major role in the routine physiotherapy treatment.  The parents will require a great deal of support and encouragement from the physiotherapist, who must be ready to organise professional physiotherapy at crisis times in the family as well as in the event of an exacerbation.

Title: Medical management of cystic fibrosis
Authors: Norman-A-P
Abstract: The manifestations of cystic fibrosis make it a complex disease, in the management of which the respiratory physician, the microbiologist, the gastroenterologist and last but not least, the psychologist, all are or should be involved.  About 1 in 10 babies with cystic fibrosis are born with acute intestinal obstruction due to plugging of the small intestine with very sticky meconium. Diagnosis is made by the test for excess salt in the sweat, and although possible very soon after birth, it is easier to carry out at about three weeks of age when the baby sweats more freely.  The great majority of children, if not treated, tend to suffer progressively more frequent chest infections or chronic chest infections.  The reason for the tendency of the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis to become colonised by harmful bacteria is not known.  Most cystic fibrosis children absorb carbohydrate normally, but only about 50% (range 45% to 80%) of the protein and fats they eat.  The only other major problem for which any active measures may be required is the occurrence of fibrosis of the liver in about 5% of these children. Children with cystic fibrosis should be brought up from the beginning to be like other children.

Title: Cystic fibrosis in adolescents and adults
Authors: Batten-J
Abstract: With improvement in the treatment of children suffering from cystic fibrosis and increase in the average survival to about 17 years of age, many more patients with this disease are now coming under the care of thoracic physicians.  In nearly every patient, broncho-pulmonary disease is the major problem.  Pneumothorax is encountered in about 15% of the older patients and some of these occur bilaterally.  A few patients develop refractory airways obstruction and then a trial of steroids is justifiable.  Most patients with cystic fibrosis also require treatment for their pancreatic insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus is more common in cystic fibrosis than in the normal population.  Analysis of sweat is essential for diagnosis.  The psychological stresses imposed upon patients and their families are very great.

Title: Emotional problems in cystic fibrosis
Authors: McCrae-W-M
Abstract: The emotional distress associated with cystic fibrosis is considerable.  From the moment of diagnosis, delayed or not, the parents' problems multiply and for the most part these problems are at first only vaguely comprehended.  Many parents embark on the long haul of caring for their child in almost total ignorance of the disease and its implications.  The fact that the disease is inherited is of outstanding importance to the parents.  The basis of genetic counseling in the disease is the explanation of recessive inheritance.  Even when genetic counseling has been given effectively and the parents have decided to have no further children, the family planning problem is not yet solved.  The physiotherapist is also necessarily concerned with the emotional state and behaviour of the child.  Except in the latest stages of this disease the child's emotional distress is not directly related to the discomfort of his symptoms.  Over-protection by parents is understandable but it is important to persuade them that it is undesirable.  Perhaps the most difficult questions of protection arise in relation to the child's knowledge of his own disorder.  Cystic fibrosis is a miserable disease and the cause of much distress, emotional and otherwise.

Title: Cystic fibrosis
Authors: Holzel-A
Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas) is a common inherited disease which, to date, still has a fatal outcome.  The diversity of clinical manifestations and pathological findings has added further to the mysterious nature of the disease, as have the tantalizingly conflicting results of biochemical, physical and experimental studies in many laboratories of the western world.  One of the most constant clinical observations is the viscosity of the secretion of the mucosal glands in the respiratory and alimentary tracts, in the ducts of the biliary system and in the pancreas.  In approximately 10 to 15 per cent of all patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the earliest manifestation, meconium ileus, occurs in the neonatal period.  In the remaining 85 to 90 per cent of affected infants the symptoms generally become evident within the course of the first year of life.  The lung symptoms tend to dominate the clinical picture in the vast majority of untreated patients and will ultimately decide the outcome.  The lower respiratory tract is not the only part involved: nasal polyps and the accumulation of viscous secretions in the paranasal sinuses with subsequent bacterial infection are not unusual.  Pancreatic deficiency is present in the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis and consists of a gross reduction or complete absence of exocrine secretion.  Although some histological damage has been seen in the neonatal period in infants suffering from meconium ileus, in general the full-blown picture of extensive cirrhosis, with portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhages from oesophageal varices, is seen in the older child and adolescent. Screening of the newborn to enable the institution of protective measures before lung complications arise has been attempted with various techniques.  Management includes diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement.  The treatment of pulmonary disease is the most important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, and its prevention is priority number one in the over-all management.  The outlook for the child born with cystic fibrosis depends to a large extent upon the avoidance, or delay until adult life, of the two complications that threaten his existence: cor pulmonale and cirrhosis of the liver.

Title: Screening for the early detection of diseases in Great Britain
Authors: Chamberlain-J
Abstract: An account is given of screening for the early detection of disease in Great Britain today.  The organisation of screening programmes provided nationally for the whole population is described.  These include programmes for prenatal care, screening of infants, screening of schoolchildren, and screening of women for carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix.  Selective screening programmes for tuberculosis and for various industrial diseases are mentioned. Experience in provision of these services on a national scale has emphasised the importance of evaluating future screening programmes, before they are implemented, by research studies on their effectiveness, their possibly harmful side effects, and their cost. Evidence from research in screening for a number of diseases is very briefly summarized, and it is concluded that there may be some development of programmes for the early detection and treatment of hypertension and of breast cancer, but for other diseases and for multiphasic screening, evidence so far available is insufficient to warrant any immediate extension from research towards service.

Title: Studies on immunoglobulins in healthy children in various stages of development and in the chosen illnesses
Authors: Siwinska-Golebiowska-H
Abstract: The studies were carried out with view to evaluate development of immunoglobulins biosynthesis in children from birth through first year of life and up to age of 15 years as well as to establish the normal values of each immunoglobulin class in healthy children of different age in our conditions of investigations and in our geografical, social and economical situation.  There was also under consideration the evaluation of body reaction on antigenic stimulation and administration of gammaglobulin preparations.  In order to determine more broadly the development of these humoral immunity parameters in children qualitative and quantitative investigations of immunoglobulins were undertaken also in same chosen illnesses where changes in biosynthesis and metabolism of immunoglobulins may be connected with pathogenesis of illness or with type of treatment (cystic fibrosis) (C.F.), Ataxia-Telangiectasia syndrome (A-T), pituitary dwarfism, fenyloketonuria (PKU).  In some groups of children investigations were systematically repeated to evaluate the dynamism of changes.

Title: Growth characteristics and protein content of tissue-cultured fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients
Authors: Farrell-P-M, Pallavicini-J-C, Ulane-M-M
Abstract: Proliferation rates and cellular protein content have been measured in cultured fibroblasts derived from the skin of normal volunteers and cystic fibrosis patients. Three methods of measuring growth indicated that under our conditions, CF fibroblasts divide normally with a  mean doubling time of 29 hr. During the logarithmic growth phase, however, lower cell protein/DNA ratios were observed consistently in CF cultures. This difference was not present in contact-inhibited, confluent fibroblasts. The finding of an apparent reduction in protein synthesis during rapid division, coupled with an observation by others that CF fibroblasts fail to normally induce collagen formation, suggests the possibility of a disturbance in the biochemical regulation of protein synthesis.

Title: Insulin iontophoresis in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Shapiro-B-L, Pence-T-V, Warwick-W-J, Smith-Q-T
Abstract: Insulin and its vehicle without insulin were administered separately by iontophoresis to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate heterozygotes, and healthy controls. The resultant sweat chloride concentration after treatment with both preparations was compared in each individual. No difference after the two treatments was found in the control sample. A decrease in sweat chloride concentration after insulin iontophoresis in comparison with the vehicle was observed in both the CF (P smaller than 0.005) and heterozygote (P smaller than 0.01) samples. These observations suggest an involvement of insulin in CF and a possible role of insulin in sweat gland function.

Title: Decreased inhibition of platelet aggregation by PGE1 in children with cystic fibrosis and their parents
Authors: Samuels-C-E, Robinson-P-G, Elliott-R-B
Abstract: PGE1 inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in children with cystic fibrosis and their parents to a much lesser extent than in normal controls. We suggest that this may be a reliable test for heterozygote carriers of cystic fibrosis.

Title: The visibly fatty liver
Authors: Griscom-N-T, Capitanio-M-A, Wagoner-M-L, Culham-G, Morris-L
Abstract: Fatty infiltration of the liver has been identified roentgenographically in several young children. Awareness of this possibility will sometimes allow a radiologist to contribute to the understanding of the patient's metabolic and nutritional state. If a child's liver is shown to be abnormally radiolucent, cystic fibrosis should be considered.

Title: Selective bronchial arteriography in patients with cystic fibrosis and massive hemoptysis
Authors: Fellows-K-E, Stigol-L, Shuster-S, Khaw-K-T, Shwachman-H
Abstract: Massive hemoptysis is a potentially fatal complication of long- standing cystic fibrosis. Lobectomy may prevent a hemorrhagic death if the hemorrhage source can be identified and if involvement of the remaining lung tissue is mild. Selective bronchial arteriography was performed in six patients with cystic fibrosis to localize a lobar source of bleeding. Arteriographic findings correlated with bronchoscopic observations. Bronchial arteriography may be helpful when bronchoscopy cannot be done because of continuous hemorrhage or because the severity of the lung disease precludes general anesthesia, but it is not an adequate substitute for bronchoscopy in most patients.

Title: Bronchial lability in children suffering from some diseases of the bronchi
Authors: Haluszka-J, Scislicki-A
Abstract: The authors studied bronchial reactivity in children with cystic fibrosis and with deformative bronchitis. The reaction of the bronchi was studied both by inhalatory and exercise provocation. Inhalatory tests were monitored by means of a whole body plethysmograph. Free- range run was used for the exercise test, and the peak expiratory flow rate was measured. The described technique of inhalatory tests was accurate, safe, and not tiring for the patient. No distinct difference in bronchial reaction between the two groups of patients could be stated. The bronchial reaction to the inhalatory and exercise tests was stronger in both groups than in normals but not as strong as in asthmatics. The nature of bronchial hyperreactivity in those patients is still unknown. The inhalatory test seems to be more sensitive than the exercise test in detecting that hyperreactivity.

Title: Cystic fibrosis in the South West African Afrikaner.  An example of population drift, possibly with heterozygote advantage
Authors: Super-M
Abstract: An incidence of the genetic recessive disease cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) far in excess of that reported recently from other countries, has been encountered in the South West African Afrikaner. This has probably resulted from the immigration of a segment of the South African Afrikaner population rich in the gene, into South West Africa, where, for religious reasons and reasons of geographical isolation, the gene has persisted and, perhaps, increased in frequency. Malaria, which killed many of the early settlers, might have selectively spared carriers of the gene, thus enriching its occurrence in the population. Details of patients, particularly with regard to the criteria of diagnosis, are given with the relevant population and birth figures, from which an estimate of the incidence of the disease and of its carrier rate has been made. Screening of the newborn for the condition and the compiling of a register of potential and obligatory carriers are also discussed.

Title: Editorial: Cystic fibrosis
Authors: No authors available
Abstract: Cystic fibrosis, sometimes known as mucoviscidosis, is a generalised disorder of the exocrine glands which affects children, adolescents and young adults.  No biochemical abnormality may be regarded as the primary cause, although at various times it has been suggested that the defect lies in ion transport, in glycoprotein structure or in membrane permeability.  Cystic fibrosis is inherited as a Mendelian recessive, and is the commonest of all such genetic diseases in the Caucasoid populations of Western Europe and North America.  Super has detected and documented a frequency of the disease among Caucasoids in South West Africa which is considerably higher than that found anywhere else in the world.  An investigation of the ways in which the disease in South West Africa may differ, clinically or pathologically, from that found elsewhere, is necessary.

Title: Electrophoretic separation, detection, and variation of amylase isoenzymes
Authors: Skude-G
Abstract: An electrophoretic technique for demonstrating amylase isoenzymes is described. After separation in an agarose gel containing a linear polyacrylamide polymer to reduce electroendosmotic flow, the amylase fractions are visualized by incubation with a commercially available dye-starch polymer (Phadebas Amylase Test). The technique detects amylase fractions with activities below 10 U/l. Some characteristic changes in such diseases as acute and chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, macroamylasemia and inherited variants as well as after maxillofacial surgery are mentioned.

Title: Sources of the serum isoamylases and their normal range of variation with age
Authors: Skude-G
Abstract: The isoamylases in various human tissue homogenates and body fluids were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nothing suggested any significant production of amylase in the liver. Minute amounts of amylase belonging to the pancreatic group of isoamylases might be produced by the glands of the proximal duodenum. The specific group of isoamylases produced in the female genital tract could not be demonstrated in serum or urine. The activity of amylase in serum was derived from two groups of isoenzymes, one group originating from the salivary glands, the other from the pancreatic gland. The contribution of each of these two sources to the total serum amylase was determined from early foetal life to adult age. A very low activity of the salivary isoamylases was regularly found in serum from 14-week-old foetuses. The activity increased steadily with age and reached the normal adult level, about 80 U/l, at the age of 5 years. The pancreatic group of isoamylases in serum developed later; the majority of children below 3 months had no demonstrable pancreatic isoamylase activity. The activity rose slowly to reach adult level, about 80 U/l, at the age of 10 to 15 years. The activity did not vary with sex, and the diurnal variation of the isoamylase was negligible. In children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the activity of pancreatic isoamylases in serum was low.

Title: Antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Hoiby-N, Wiik-A
Abstract: Sera from 84 patients with cystic fibrosis, 31 patients with other respiratory diseases and 21 control persons have been investigated for the occurrence of antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies. Preciptins were studied by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis, antinuclear factors by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and rheumatoid factors by the latex fixation slide test. A very heterogeneous antibacterial immune response was found in patients with cystic fibrosis, notably as regards Ps. aeruginosa. None of the other patients or controls had precipitins against this bacterium. The occurrence of precipitins against St. aureus and D. pneumoniae were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients as compared with controls, but not as compared with other respiratory disease patients. No significant differences were found as regards precipitins against H. influenzae or the occurrence of rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear factors were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients than in the other two groups investigated. A pronounced and heterogeneous humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with mucoid strains of this bacterium was found to be correlated with poor prognosis and the reason for this is discussed.

Title: Soluble proteins of bronchopulmonary secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis, asthma, and bronchitis
Authors: Brogan-T-D, Ryley-H-C, Neale-L, Yassa-J
Abstract: The concentrations of nine plasma proteins were determined by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis in sputum specimens from 29 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and from 24 patients with severe asthma and chronic bronchitis. The results suggested that the population of CF patients could be divided into two groups in spite of an absence of difference in clinical status between the groups. Average concentrations of seven plasma proteins in sputum of group I CF patients were identical with those in sputum of patients with bronchitis, but the average concentrations of six of these proteins in sputum from group II CF patients were higher than those in specimens from the bronchitic patients and were similar to corresponding concentrations in sputum from patients with asthma, all of whom were examined while in status asthmaticus. The average concentrations of 14 secretory proteins were the same in all sputum specimens whether or not they were produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, asthma or bronchitis. It was concluded that the concentrations in the bronchopulmonary secretions of proteins associated with host defence were not diminished in patients with cystic fibrosis, and failure to produce adequate concentrations of proteins with antimicrobial activity was unlikely to be responsible for the above average susceptibility to chest infection in cystic fibrosis. It is suggested that there exists a group of CF patients in whom a pulmonary allergic reaction generates an inflammatory response as severe as that characterizing status asthmaticus and that this response could be detrimental.

Title: The pulmonary circulation in cystic fibrosis
Authors: Ryland-D, Reid-L
Abstract: The hearts and lungs of 36 patients dying of cystic fibrosis have been studied to establish the relationship between right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), pathological changes in the pulmonary circulation, and the clinical features. The presence and degree of RVH were measured by Fulton's technique of weighing the ventricles separately. Of the subjects who died after the age of 3 years, one in six had no RVH, although the mean age of this group was not significantly different from that of the remainder. There was no correlation between duration of cyanosis, haemoglobin levels, and RVH. Although not statistically significant, the cases without RVH tended to have had clubbing of the finger-nails for longer periods before death. The electrocardiogram was useful in the diagnosis of RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy was common in children with lungs of large volume as judged by the radiographic centile of lung length. Cases with RVH show reduced background haze in the arteriogram and fewer arteries per unit area of lung. For the first time thickening of the medial muscle layer proportional to the degree of RVH has been demonstrated, only in the smaller arteries. Arterial subintimal fibrosis is more common in cases with RVH, as is thickening of the walls of small pulmonary veins. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: The comparison of peak flow rate with other spirometric measurements in cyctic fibrosis patients
Authors: Gocmen-A
Abstract: This study was done to determine the role of the Wright peak flowmeter for evaluation of pulmonary functions in children with cystic fibrosis.  Peak expiratory flow rate was measured with the use of a Wright peak flowmeter and one second forced expiratory volume, maximal mid-expiratory flow rate and maximal voluntary ventilation were measured with a spirometer in a total of 55 children, 25 of whom had cystic fibrosis disease, with the remainder being normal.  Measurements were repeated after administration of bronchodilating drugs to the cystic fibrosis patients.  All the values of the four measurements were decreased significantly in the cystic fibrosis patients.  Positive and significant correlation co-efficients were obtained by comparing the peak flow rate with other spirometric measurements.  It was concluded that peak expiratory flow rate is a feasible and useful measurement of pulmonary functions in cystic fibrosis patients.  No changes were observed after administration of bronchodilating drugs to these patients.

Title: Clinico-pathological evaluation of 37 cases of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas in infancy at necropsy
Authors: Tinaztepe-B, Kural-N, Tinaztepe-K, Gocmen-A
Abstract: The clinical and morphological findings of 37 cases of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas from 525 full, but non-consecutive necropsies are presented.  All of these 37 cases were diagnosed at post-mortem examination.  The autopsy incidence was 7% and none of the cases was beyond two years of age.  Morphological findings revealed varying severities in organ involvement in all cases, with absence of fibrosis of the pancreas in some.  In only two cases histopathological changes seemed to be confined to the pancreas. This study suggests that cystic fibrosis plays a considerable role in infant deaths in our country and in most if not all cases the diagnosis must necessarily be based on postmortem studies.

Title: Letter: Congenital absence of vasa
Authors: Roth-S-S, Roth-R-A
Abstract: Although it is generally true that most male patients with cystic fibrosis are infertile due to congenital atresia or absence of the vasal structures, this finding is not invariable.  Taussig et al. reported 2 well-studied patients with cystic fibrosis who had normal semen analysis, and at this writing both have fathered children.  A third patient with normal semen analysis also is known to us.  In addition there are many instances of presumed but undocumented paternity in these patients.  Cystic fibrosis centers estimate male fertility at 2 to 3 per cent; although low, this figure warrants semen analysis before assuming sterility.  In view of this, we feel that the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be considered when the vasa are absent, but it is incorrect to exclude the diagnosis on the basis of palpable vasa.

Title: Letter: Cystic fibrosis and absence of vas deferens
Authors: Kornitzer-G-D, Newton-R-A
Abstract: Infertility and abnormalities of the mesonephric derivatives are common in patients with cystic fibrosis, but it is not a uniform finding.  Taussig et al. reported on 2 patients with cystic fibrosis who had proved fertility.  Abnormalities of the vas could be documented in pathologic studies, but the vas was found to be present in some patients who died of cystic fibrosis.  In many patients, absence could not be ruled out on physical examination.  In healthy, young children the vas is not easily palpable; even when it is, the degree of certainty in its identification is less than in the post-pubertal male.  Cystic fibrosis is a disease with protean manifestations, and it would be a mistake to rule out cystic fibrosis just because the vas can be palpated or to have victims of cystic fibrosis labeled as infertile.

Title: Obscure bilateral calcified swellings of paratesticular tissues
Authors: Dajani-A-M
Abstract: A case of calcified swellings of the paratesticular tissues discovered in an infant at different ages is described.  The exact cause is obscure; and three pathologic conditions are suggested. Possibly it was due to an old reaction to meconium peritonitis through a patent processus vaginalis.

Title: Cystic fibrosis complicated by heart failure
Authors: Moss-A-J, Dooley-R-R, Mickey-M-R
Abstract: Survival studies were done on 36 children with cystic fibrosis and heart failure.  Thirty percent did not survive the first four weeks, and the median survival for the group was between two and three months.  By the end of the first year from the onset of failure, 74 percent had died and at 30 months, 87 percent had died.

Title: Isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis
Authors: Dominick-H-C, Husen-N-V, Hosemann-R, Gerlach-U
Abstract: In 36 children with cystic fibrosis (CF), the isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase (AP) were determined microelectrophoretically in polyacrylamide- and starch-gel.  The study was done to evaluate the clinical significance of these additional data for the diagnosis of liver involvement in CF.  The results lead to the following conclusions.  Serum activity of total AP is comparatively unsensitive "masking" alterations in the isoenzyme pattern contributing to the AP serum activity.  In 17 children resp. 47% bile-duct phosphatase was increased indicating a secretostasis while other marker enzymes of cholestasis were normal in part.  The activity of bone phosphatase in the serum showed a significant correlation to the degree of growth retardation in these patients. Intestinal phosphatase was present in the serum of only one child with cirrhosis of the liver being an indicator for liver insufficiency.  Determination of AP isoenzymes in the serum may provide additional information about the organs involved for the physician in handling CF patients.
